0358067316;0;0358067316;4.0;"The thing that struck me while I was reading ""Guest: A Changeling Tale"" by Mary Downing Hahn is that poor Mollie felt tension from all sides.<br /><br />Mollie lives in a vague time and in a vague place where the 'others' are not very far. Her little brother, Thomas, is a beautiful boy and because of that, all who see him try to keep from acknowledging it as it will tempt those called the ""Kinde Folke"" to steal him away. Older sister, Mollie, makes the mistake of giving her young brother sweet words of praise. Not long after, Thomas is taken and a changeling is left in his place. As noted, the tension for Mollie to fix the situation comes from all sides but she wants to remedy the situation so she  (and the changeling she calls ""Guest"") go off on the journey to find Thomas and bring him back.<br /><br />Like most Downing Hahn books, the story doesn't go overly long and it isn't overly done either. The author writes plain yet pointed prose which keeps the plot and pace even. What I do appreciate about this book is that there is an ambiguity from start to finish that kept me guessing on what the outcome would be. It was a nice change of pace and an enjoyable read.";1568936923481;Tension from all sides;AGSP6LSQK32SQEJO3YVVNACPWMSQ;False

1338569090;0;1338569090;3.0;(3.5)<br />As the book starts, Emily is in trouble for sassing her mother even going so far as to making her mother cry. That's really quite bad in and of it's self! Bad Emily! Later on, she overhears her parents speaking and her mother leaves. She's gone awhile and soon her dad says he has to go somewhere but he'll be back soon. When the days stretch on and he doesn't come back either Emily realizes she's going to have to find them. She realizes this is even more urgent after a strange person knocks on her door and, well, you'll have to read the book to find out how strange and why she realizes just how important things are.<br />This is a good middle grade book. It's a good story for all ages I think but some things might be more appropriate for children on the higher end of the 8-12 recommendation. I would let my 8 year old read it without worry but some might not feel it entirely safe for a little bit of the language used. Emily can be a bit rude as well and the meanness to her mom was a bit harsh but it's a story. It all works itself out, or if it doesn't it opens up a good line of communication with a child.<br />The story was well written and the second one in the series is likely as good.

0985101008;3;0985101008;5.0;"This was one great book.  It's categorized as a self-help book and it most certainly is but let me tell you, it is so much more than most of the self-help books out there (at least those that I've read).  From the very first page it is easy to see that it has its own style and stands out from others.  I really enjoyed reading this book and was surprised at how much I learned from it about myself and the world around me in general (that sounds so silly when I type it that way, but seriously read it and you will get it!).<br /><br />As with all my reviews (that I'm sure you've never read any of :P) I don't like to give a lot away when it comes to story and plot line because I hate risking ruining things for the reader and I think it's so cruel to take away the joy of reading by getting spoilers in the review process so I'll keep it general but as focused as best as my ""too fast for their own good"" typing fingers can do.<br /><br />What is really great about this book is that it really inspires the reader to make personal choices through their own free will and pretty much makes you take a look at actions and choices and lets you see that the choices you make are yours.  Sounds simple enough, but it's amazing how simple enough it is not!  This book almost reads like short stories (yes, a self-help book written in story form with characters and an actual story going on, it's rather cool to be blunt about it) chapter and section by chapter and section.  It's engaging and fun to read.  You can read it in one sitting or you can read a section at a time and come back to it when you want to (which will be pretty quick I'm guessing!).  You will learn to take control of your life and the choices that you make in your life (every day and business) and take away some amazing lessons from reading this book.<br /><br />I would really suggest that when you read this book, which you really should do, you get out either a highlighter if you are a book marker-upper, a notebook, or get ready to highlight the heck out of your e-reader because you will want to make note of a lot of the lessons and thoughts within this book in order to be able to look back on them later.  This book has a way of getting to you where you will either want to go back to certain parts of it or even reread it a few times.  It can give you new perspectives, remind you of old perspectives you may have forgotten in the everyday shuffle of life, and it may just give you a little push in the right direction.  This is a great book and I would recommend it to just about everyone if you are looking for inspiration in taking charge in everyday life.  It's a great read that I really enjoyed a lot.";1366921824000;Highly Recommended;AHWCZ47A7FIYEJ7KEJG3BO3F5YXQ;False

But she basically tells people to experiment on your own and record your observations in a journal.

1501864815;3;1501864815;3.0;This book contains 100 short devotions based off of Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s theological writings. For each entry, there's the verse reference that you look up in your own Bible. It's usually a chunk of 4-12 verses which Bonhoeffer was referring to in that day's quote. Then there's a short, 1-3 sentence long quote from Bonhoeffer. Then the author wrote 4-5 paragraphs of commentary on the Bonhoeffer quote, usually re-quoting the day's quote as he went. He explained the context of the quote and where it came from, clarified what Bonhoeffer meant (though usually that was obvious), and left the reader with a core, Christian concept to meditate on throughout the day. Each entry was about 1.5 pages long and only took a few minutes to read. While the author used good, core Christian concepts in the devotions, I had thought there was going to be more of Bonhoeffer--the devotion being Bonhoeffer's writings themselves, not someone talking about what he said. So it was fine, just not what I'd expected.;1536599813383;Commentary on Bonhoeffer's writings;AGRCXV4NM763VGZGD6BQ2VGNCJNA;False
1586280554;1;1586280554;4.0;Cody is a cool cow who loves his family and soccer. He is also allergic to milk. This book focuses on the feelings some children may have when discovering they have an allergy. At first Cody fears he did something wrong that has caused him to be allergic to milk. After all, Cody’s friends and family can drink milk. He then accepts that he was born with the allergy and did nothing to cause it. The book also educates the reader on foods that can hide milk such as ice cream, yogurt, and candy bars. Additionally, the book points out the difference between lactose intolerance and a severe allergy. Cody gets hives, swelling, coughing, and he could even stop breathing. Cody and his family are very careful about the foods that he eats, but his mom still carries an EpiPen everywhere he goes. He is still able to eat other fun foods and he and his parents hope that he will grow out of it one day. There is a note to parents and teacher in the back along with a list of resources.<br /><br />Similar to Allie The Allergic Elephant this book does a great job of capturing several elements of allergies from the feelings the person with allergies might experience to the act of carrying an EpiPen. Unfortunately, it also contains the same unrefined illustrations. Hopefully adults and children can move past them and embrace these books for the wonderful tools they are!;1517691805692;Very Educational;AH44RUNOBWHIMDEJ6LMNKJU7PPMQ;False
B00BPA1T8G;0;B00BPA1T8G;4.0;Ordinary Grace is a novel that has been getting a lot of buzz, and since I tend to enjoy coming of age stories, I decided to give this one a try.  The story is narrated by Frank Drum, looking back at his youth in Bremen, Minnesota, in particular the summer of 1961 when Frank was just thirteen years old son.<br /><br />Frank is the middle child, his older sister Ariel is eighteen and a talented pianist. She has a promising future in store, having been accepted at Julliard School of Music. Younger brother Jake, is eleven and suffers bullying and humiliation for his stuttering, an affliction which only seems to surface when he is outside of his home. Their father is a Methodist minister in town and their mother Ruth is unhappy in her role as the wife of a minister. Ruth is a woman who was a talented musician and thought she would be marrying a lawyer, but war changes people, and after Nathan returned from the war, he felt a calling toward religious life instead. His wife doesn't share a strong faith in God to do the right thing, especially when time and again bad things happen in life.<br /><br />In this normally quiet town four deaths occur in that summer of 1961, the first one involving a developmentally disabled young boy along the train tracks, and shortly after, in the same area, a homeless man is also found dead. Two more deaths/murders follow and one in particular, changes this family forever.<br /><br />Part mystery, part coming of age story, this was an enjoyable story that held my interest until the very end.  The characters were compelling, and the writing good, but I had an issue with the way Frank always seemed to be in just the right place to overhear critical conversations, yet I do understand with a story like this, that device might have been needed to move the story a long.  Despite this minor issue, Ordinary Grace is a worthwhile read.  The audio book was read by,  Rich Orlow, who did a great job.;1392386110000;great audiobook!;AHAR2ITQ3O2FJJDLIORAQ226KZHQ;False
1906002231;5;1906002231;4.0;Not your typical rock star type autobiography, but then Bruford isn't your typical rock star.  In fact, post Yes, not a rock star at all.  This was really more of philosophical treatise than an accounting of his career.  A great deal about what it is like being a musician, especially one who plays more for art than money.  His view of his profession, as well of his career, was a little bit disturbing.  I know the music business is about as sleazy as the movie business, and he drove that point home.  He also doesn't seem particularly happy about his career overall.  More than a bit of sadness as he looks at it from the perspective of it being behind him now.  A bit of bitterness, along with some very revealing insights.<br /><br />I enjoyed it and recommend it, although perhaps not for the reasons I expected.  Not a kiss and tell approach with a couple of notable exceptions.  I believe I would enjoy dinner with Mr. Bruford.  I don't thing I would enjoy one with Robert Fripp.<br /><br />For the record, pun intended, Bruford is one of my favorite all time drunners.  Loved his work with Yes, and contrary to his statements otherwise, Alan White was not up to the task of filling his shoes, really enjoyed some of the fusion work, especially when he was working with Jeff Berlin and Alan Holdsworth, and my tastes followed his as I became more of an acoustic jazz fan.  I own all of the Earthworks albums.  They require more of the listener than his earlier works, but were the creations of very sophisticated, talented musicians.  I was very happy when he got through his electronic kit phase.  Give me five seconds of any Bruford piece with his snare and I can identify the drunner.  King Crimson is a notable exception to the above.  I wanted to like them.  Perhaps Fripp's personality came through too much for my tastes...;1375665180000;Different....;AH57HG2KBYU43RIFMRLOKTLYFIGA;True
B003QKALOQ;0;B003QKALOQ;5.0;"Horatio Alger would love John Maxwell's ""Failing Forward."" Maxwell's bestseller is about persevering though crisis and through hard failures.<br /><br />Like many of his self-help contemporaries, Maxwell use lists to outline his ideas. Also like the other books on the ""how to live life better"" are inspiring anecdotes of famous success stories, like Mary Kay Ash and the late Truett Cathy. It sounds like an Amway sales seminar.<br /><br />Where I think this book is different is that Maxwell feels free to acknowledge failure as a given. Rather than pretending failure is a negative attitude, he unpretentiously says failure should be embraced. It is part of the risk process.<br /><br />Failure, Maxwell contends, is part of success. His play on words ""failing forward"" instead of ""falling forward"" is means more than to bring a smile. Like a running back in football, tackled hard by a player much bigger, will try to use the momentum of falling to reach the football another foot or two into the end zone. If he fell backwards, he loses a yard. If he falls forward, his team gets a touchdown. That is more or less Maxwell's thesis in the book.<br /><br />It is excellent as an audiobook for those with long commutes.<br /><br />I fully recommend ""Failing Forward: How to Make the Most of Your Mistakes"" by John Maxwell.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />americanspeechwriter.com";1410199144000;Failure is a Given: Work With It;AGXFIFO4VWNHPAX3VJPRQ2QJSCSQ;False

That's why teens are reading this book. That is why more often than not, they enjoy it more than writers like William Faulkner.<br /><br />J. D. Salinger was not a shock artist. He did not use offensive themes and language to stir up publicity and talk about freedom of speech. He employed his freedom of speech as a tool to communicate, not to infuriate. As a result, he wrote a magnificent book looking into the psyche of youth. What makes Salinger a classic writer, and wealthy publicity hounds like Eminem and Howard Stern noisy wannabes is that within his language, there is truth.<br /><br />While Holden searches for himself, and the meaning of life, he was a younger version of those in the Beat movement, or James Dean. Readers go from ""Catcher"" to Jack Kerouac's ""On the Road,"" with the same easygoing, streaming thoughts kind of way.<br /><br />""The Catcher in the Rye"" grabs at the introspective self.

0451406257;5;0451406257;5.0;This book is well written and engaging.  I recommend it for people who are interested in true crime and who have the stomach for it.<br /><br />The author was a police officer in Chicago.  This gave her a lot of important insights into the situation and an understanding of many issues such as prostitution and how the Chicago criminal justice system and the Chicago press works.<br /><br />According to the back cover Robin Gecht had at one time been a co-worker of John Wayne Gacey.  This is ironic in the sense that Gecht could have very easily ended up in Gacey's crawl space but fate had other plans for him.<br /><br />People in this world will I guess often cross paths with others who want to follow the same destiny as themselves.  It could only have been the dark forces of hell that brought these characters together.  There's an undercurrent of Satanism throughout the book even including activities at the High School that these nuts occasionally attended.<br /><br />Gecht and his pals engaged in Satanic rituals.  Gecht seemed to have some sort of hypnotic power over them which they could not easily describe to the police.<br /><br />The mother of a missing girl was talking to Gecht who just seemed to ramble on and on until she finally realized that he was somehow hypnotizing her.  He had what I guess is called an 'evil eye'.<br /><br />People like this become possessed by a perverse and evil force.  They are expressing their desire to get into hell I believe.  In that sense the true explanation for their behavior will not be found in psychology.  It will be found in the spirit world.<br /><br />There is some suspicion that Gecht attempted to kill another prostitute even after he had been questioned by the police and was bonded out of jail.  He must have realized that the noose was closing in on him.  If this is true it shows how powerful his need to do evil was.  Nothing else mattered.  This evil force had completely taken control of his miserable life.  It seems like the police should have been keeping closer tabs on him at that point in the investigation.<br /><br />FBI profiler Robert Ressler happened to be in Chicago when one of these horrific crime scenes was discovered and he provided a psychological profile of the killer.  He predicted the killer would be slight of build and bisexual but perhaps secretly.  That was deadly accurate for Gecht.<br /><br />All of these characters had sexual issues.  A serial killer, although sexually motivated, actually has an aversion to sex I think.<br /><br />The Ripper Crew found some spare time to drive up to a group of guys and just start shooting them.  One was killed instantly and another will be in a wheel chair for the rest of his life.<br /><br />They 'left their mark' as the dim witted Tommy Kokoraleis profoundly expressed it.<br /><br />Being the coward that he is Gecht requested to be segregated from the rest of the prison population, correctly realizing that, as Jeffrey Dahmer found out too late, his hypnotic powers and black magic would not protect him from the vengeance of the inmates.  Indeed there are many forms of 'black magic' inside of prison.<br /><br />These guys are hell bound.

0785127240;6;0785127240;5.0;"The setting for this story is the same as that for George R. R. Martin's acclaimed ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" epic fantasy series.  The time period is about 90-100 years before the events of the first book in the series, ""A Game of Thrones"".  The main character is a very tall young man named Duncan, who was the squire of a hedge knight, Ser Arlen Pennytree.<br /><br />A hedge knight is a freelance fighting man.  He makes his living by hiring out his services to lords of the land and also by fighting for the prize money at tournaments.  A hedge knight is not beholden to any Lord, and can choose to accept only those jobs that they feel is morally right.  However, a hedge knight is landless and must ""scrape out"" a meager living.  Ser Arlen dies from a fever chill on the way to a tournament.  Duncan buries his old master beside the road, says a prayer, and decides to compete in the tournament in the place of the deceased hedge knight.  He packs the horses and takes the road to Ashford.  On the way, he crosses paths with a bald-headed young man called ""Egg"" and agrees to take the youngster as his own squire.<br /><br />After much trouble, Duncan, who styles himself ""Ser Duncan the Tall"", finally gets his name on the tournament list.  Unfortunately, trouble found him in the form of an altercation with one of the princes of the ruling House Targaryen.  Ser Duncan intervenes while Prince Aerion Targaryen is in the process of beating a woman.<br /><br />For his crime, Duncan was to lose a hand and a foot.  However, the good Prince Baelor Targaryen gives him a choice: Trial by Combat.  After much negotiation with the accusing party, it was agreed that it was to be a Trial of Seven.  Prince Aerion would pick seven fighters on his side, and Ser Duncan must find seven to stand with him.<br /><br />On the night prior, Ser Fossoway, promises to help Duncan.  Egg, who turned out to be Prince Aegon Targaryen V, also promised to bring in honorable knights to help fight for Duncan's cause.  During the morning of the tournament, Ser Fossoway tells Duncan that he has decided to fight for the other side, Aerion having made a promise to grant him his own lands if he were to do so.  Meanwhile, Fossoway's squire, enraged by his master's treachery asked to be knighted so that he may fight on Duncan's side.  Aegon also brings in four other knights, including two from the Hardyng family and one from the Baratheon clan.  Still, they are one knight short.  Duncan appeals to the crowd, asking them to fight for his cause.  Not one of the noble knights present wanted to risk their lives, or offend their Lord, by fighting for him.  However, at the last minute, Prince Baelor Targaryen himself decides to take Duncan's side and agrees to fight for him.<br /><br />During the fight, Prince Aerion unhorses Ser Duncan and proceeds to beat him with a morning star.  Obviously at a skill disadvantage, Duncan relies on his great size and street fighting style.  He manages to grapple Aerion to the ground and pounds the prince with his shield.  The prince yields and withdraws his charge against Duncan.<br /><br />The fight claimed the lives of both of the Hardyngs, as well as the life of Prince Baelor Targaryen.  Towards the end, Prince Maekar Targaryen offers Duncan a position among his household knights, and asked him if he would take his son, Aegon V, to be his squire.  Aegon had declared that he would never squire for anyone but Ser Duncan the Tall.  Ser Duncan agrees to take on Aegon as his squire, but only on the condition that he be allowed to travel and live the life of a hedge knight.  And so begins the adventures of ""Dunk and Egg"".<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to youngsters.  Lots of good, moral values there.  Here are some that came to my attention:<br /><br />1)  There are good, and bad ""apples"", in every family.  Witness the pettiness and cruelty of Prince Aerion Targaryen.  Compared to the nobility and generosity of both Aegon Targaryen and Prince Baelor Targaryen.  Prince Baelor, considered to be the greatest knight of his generation,  willing to die so that a lowly Hedge Knight might prove his innocence.<br />2)  Most times, we trade our personal code of ethics for a life of security and prosperity.  The knights who refused to lend a hand were all beholden to the service of their lords.  They live comfortably in their castles.  And yet, it is the hedge knight, a landless knight, who is most true to the vow to ""protect the weak"" and to stand up for what is right.  How many times have you compromised your ethics just to make a sale?  As a manager, how many times have you fired  employees, knowing they did not deserve it, simply because it served the needs of the employer?<br />3)  How many times have we abandoned a friend, or a cause, just because the opposing side had more to offer us?<br /><br />These are just moral themes that came to mind as I was reading this terrific short story.  I suggest that if you can afford it, buy a few copies and donate them to your child's school library.";1232633803000;A thrilling adventure, with a moral lesson.;AEF4REQMG4I6Y2JLLKMQE4U2QYXQ;True
0312536631;0;0312536631;5.0;A great satire that manages to hit everything from STARSHIP TROOPERS to VietNam strategists to STAR WARS.<br /><br />Some military conventions are deliberately inverted.  The draft targets well-educated young people instead of giving them deferments for college.  Instead of punishing insubordinate soldiers, this army encourages them to let off steam by cursing their officers in unison  (F*** YOU, SIR!).  Coed units (a novelty in the 1970s) are organized in the hope that sex will distract the soldiers from other deprivations.<br /><br />Likewise science fiction conventions.  By leaving out the usual conveniences like hyperdrive and computer-translators, we get a convincing war that cannot end because messages take years to reach their destinations and nobody understands enough of the alien language to even ask for peace terms.<br /><br />It helps that Halderman actually had experience in VietNam and even likes some elements of military service, rather than being an attack by an ivory-tower ideologue.<br /><br />Some of the other reviewers don't seem to understand satire.  They complain about the loose plot, flat characters, frequent references to sex, or the deliberate deus-ex-machina ending, all of which are traditional in satirical works  ( CANDIDE, GULLIVER'S TRAVELS, the plays of Aristophanes);1263658236000;The best science-fiction satire.;AHDDO3GS4F7HHJZNDYSTI4PDMXPQ;False

1400065879;6;1400065879;4.0;"With an unequivocal love and pride in my heritage, and an unwavering love and concern for the State Of Israel, I am always trying to improve my knowledge, of what ""has been"", ""what is"", and ""what will be"", relating to Israel. Not only for myself, but also for the responsibility, I was born with, to educate my son. We have watched DVD's on the history of Israel, and read many books, and one of the historical leaders, warriors, and character's, who shines through, among the most important, is Ariel Sharon. When I found this book, with no prior fanfare, or buildup, I briefly leafed through it. And one paragraph, caught my eye, that basically said: ""An Israeli government vehicle with civilian plates, boarded an Egyptian ferry... the workers on board, easily recognized the rotund man, with the flowing white hair, in the back of the sedan. They knew him, as the most notorious, of all Israeli generals, Ariel Sharon... the man who six years earlier had crossed the same canal, at the head of a column of tanks, winning the pivotal battle in the Sinai campaign of the Yom Kippur War. He was now in Egypt on official, if covert, business, as Israel's minister of agriculture."" With that passage, I purchased the 500-page book. Let me advise you, this is not an exciting, entertaining read. You're reading, not only the history of a remarkable man, but also the history of a country. Another reason, I believe the wording, isn't, continually jumping off the page, is the fact that it was translated. But, it was information, I was looking for on Sharon, and this book (Which is more like an encyclopedia!) delivered. This tome does not pull punches. Sharon, has made mistakes, and upset many people. I was raised to believe, that if you're not making somebody mad, you're doing something wrong. I learned, that there is way more infighting in Israeli politics then meets the eye. (At least mine.) But I'm sure someone from another country, seeking to learn more about America, like I want to learn more about Israel, would have the same impression. Until Sharon's recent stroke, there was not one war, in Israel's entire history, that he wasn't involved in. As a military leader, his troops loved to fight for him.

0525950435;1;0525950435;3.0;While the information Sylvia gives us from her spirit guide Francine is good, there's so little of it in this very thing book, that I don't think it's worth the asking price.  Maybe if Sylvia combined this book with a couple of her other books, and then left out the personal antidotes and tenets of her church, it might be worth the price.<br /><br />Reading The Two Marys must reminded me why I tend to steer clear of Sylvia's work, there's just not much there. I always get the feeling that she's in this thing to make money, and putting in double-spaced, large print, thin books, with just a dab of information, is her way of filling her coffers.<br /><br />As for the information that is in the book, which constitutes 3/5ths of the book, which is why I gave it 3 out of 5 stars, it's very good.  Finally we see the two Marys as something more than a womb and a prostitute.  I'm sure its because of the patriarchal times that both women were downplayed, and even insulted as they were, so it's nice to see some truth about who they really were, and the impact they had on Christianity.  Of course my fundamentalist mother would shout blasphemy for even considering that woman had anything to teach a man, but if it's true that men are to guide us through the physical world, and women are to guide us through the world of spirit, than Mary Magdalene teaching Christ's message makes perfect sense.<br /><br />I was bothered by how downplayed the role of Jesus was.  Yes, this is the story of the Marys, but having Jesus just hang around after the Crucifixion teaching children, seemed strange to me, or maybe just a little out of balance.  Religion plays his part up to the point of being God himself, so having him be human was maybe just too much to handle.<br /><br />Lastly, Sylvia Browne has her own religion, and as L. Ron Hubbard once said, if you want to be really rich, start your own religion.  I'm sure Sylvia means well, but I'm having a hard time seeing much difference between what she is doing, and what so many televangelists are doing, only with Sylvia it's the new age brand of religion.;1316099779000;too short;AGL3YAW5MYLT5ORWAI2UUKZ2Q4NA;False

0808022873;4;0808022873;3.0;I bought this two volume set when I was a Compliance Manager for an individual health insurance company.  The purchase date was shortly after the March 2010 enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.  I thought the books did a great job of organizing the sections of this complex piece of legislation - however due to all of the Interim Final Regulations that were published between March 2010 and December 2010, some of the critical components of the book became somewhat outdated.  It was a great reference to have right away, but I would advise purchasing this book only if you want the legislation organized in an easy-to-read format.;1299345986000;Health Care Reform Books;AGODYNWWUCJ4COMAY36OD366OHWA;True

B008PRT470;2;B008PRT470;4.0;"I have never read a writer who has such a command of literary technique as Rafael Sabatini. His plots are intriguing, extremely well thought out, colorful and historically accurate. He has the knack of describing settings meticulously without being tedious. Each of his characters (not just the major ones) are superbly developed. I loved Captain Blood when I was 13 years old and today, nearly 40 years later, it still holds tremendous fascination for me (and for my now 13- and 17-year old children). As a child, I admired the fast moving plot, the wonderful use of dialect and those beautiful words (most of which I had to look up in a dictionary) which Sabatini used to paint pictures in his readers' minds. This collection has given me the opportunity to read his other works which are no less superb than Captain Blood. Scaramouche and Seahawk are just as well written as Captain Blood, although all three books feature innocent men who suffer unjust punishment for crimes they did not commit. Sabatini seems to be fascinated by the ideal of men who suffer tremendous injustice, but whose nobility, gallantry and magnanimity triumph inspite of unimaginable persecution. In our world today where the word &#34;virtue&#34; is hardly ever heard or written about anymore, it is refreshing to read novels where such qualities are demonstrated in the light they deserve. Another reviewer mentioned the amazing expansion your vocabulary will enjoy if you read Sabatini. I couldn't agree more. Anytime you want to be transported out of your world into an exciting, action packed one, pick up a Sabatini adventure. You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this collection 4 stars is that there seems to be quite a number of typographical errors in the novels. Nothing you can't figure out, but it does detract from the reading experience. Interrupts the rhythm of the reading, so to speak. But I'm finding out that this is a common defect of many Kindle books.";1402624202000;Why don't they write like this anymore?;AHLHKUT2Q7RYDHM3FWFVBPXGYO3Q;True

There are five themes which weave through the historical narrative: 1) Stanford White (1853-1906), renowned architect during the turn of the century and partner in the nation’s most prominent architectural firm, Mead, McKim & White. 2) Augustus Saint-Gaudens (1848-1907), America’s preeminent sculptor during the same period, known for his Civil War monuments and Classical works. 3) Construction of the second Madison Square Garden, a multi-purpose arena designed in opulent Italianate/Moorish style with a dramatic 32-story tower modeled after the Cathedral of Seville. 4) Creation of the Classical goddess Diana, a gilded metal sculpture which graced the peak of the tower. 5) The friendship, artistic collaboration and lifestyles of White and Saint-Gaudens. Each theme makes for a good story, with the backdrop of New York City during its economic and cultural emergence into the 20th century. The creative talents which made the arena possible would be replaced in subsequent years by an economic reality which led to razing the grand entertainment palace in 1925. The subtitle—Art, Scandal and Architecture in Gilded Age New York—is an apt description.

1400032806;10;1400032806;4.0;"When I first read Jon Krakauer's INTO THIN AIR, I became fascinated with all things Everest.  (All things except actually climbing the growing peak, that is.)  So when this became a book club pick, my curiosity was piqued.  (Glad I got my 'p' word quota out of the way this early.)<br /><br />Jon Krakauer weaves together in UNDER THE BANNER OF HEAVEN a subjective (and quite unflattering) view of the origins of the Mormon church, or The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, along with the criminal story of two men, Dan and Ron Lafferty, and how their ""removal revelation"" from God instructed them to kill four associates, including a sister-in-law and her infant daughter.<br /><br />There is some in-depth historical material about the church and its fundamentalist offshoots where names started to blur in a Biblical ""begat"" kind of way, but perhaps that was just eyeball fatigue.  Otherwise, this is a fascinating account of the birth of a modern religion, still one of the fastest-growing in this country, and the dangers of literalism and fundamentalism in ANY form.<br /><br />This book was a page-turner for me because I am fascinated by people who claim to hear God talk to them...especially when God delivers revelations not in Aramaic or Hebrew or Greek or Ancient Egyptian, but in quasi-King James English.  Go historically linguistic or completely modern, I say, but don't split the difference.<br /><br />This work is captivating enough that there are several points that I still can't get out of my head.  When Ron finds no one home on the day of the killings, who or what tells Dan to turn  around and try again?  Outside of a Good God/Bad Devil duality worldview, what was guiding their actions that day?  I'm also puzzled by the dazzling white light that filled the room of an obstinate girl one morning (if memory serves) that convinced her to become a plural wife when she had gone to bed the night before in complete opposition to the idea.  And didn't the Lafferty brothers ultimately worship a pretty weak God as their own...one that couldn't take care of the four people that were supposedly in His way?  Couldn't He simply orchestrate a car accident or two?  Or does He just have us on closed-circuit television somewhere in the cosmos?  One of many worlds He's created?  Perhaps EVERYONE's over-booked these days.  Intriguing supernatural tidbits like that that have kept my mind racing since reading them.<br /><br />But I digress. This work is quite an interesting (and subjective) look at the very American religion of Mormonism.  I personally wish there were more investigation into the supernatural side of divine revelation as that is the crux of the problem with those who claim to speak for God, but still much to ponder upon finishing the book.  Although I don't think the LDS get the fairest of shakes by Mr. Krakauer, Christianity and organized religion in general have all come under the microscope in recent centuries as well.  Perhaps the Mormon church should take it as a sign that they have finally arrived.";1160671743000;Fascinating Take on LDS Origins, Current Schisms and a Tragic Crime Spree;AGTCDVYPH4GHL43O6BNCV7AELQSA;False

My personal preference is still for &#34;Alaska&#34; (emphasis on personal), but this might be his finest work yet.  It's certainly getting him press.<br /><br />It's a tragic romance about a teen girl and a teen boy, both with cancer, and their daily struggles (spoiler: their daily struggles are much harder than ours, like being able to breathe).  And it's not schmaltzy like Nicholas Sparks -- no one kisses in the rain, no one writes letters (well, they do, but in a much MUCH better way).  It's much more realistic, and the tragedy is the realism of dying.  That it's not glorious or romantic, but authentic.  And that is so much more tragic and so much better.

0062424300;0;0062424300;4.0;Far along in Matthew Quick’s novel titled, The Reason You’re Alive, readers learn that the title of the book is also the title of a painting. By the time we learn that fact, we’ve come to know protagonist David Granger quite well. This sixty-eight-year-old Vietnam vet becomes obsessed with finding a Native American soldier from his past. Granger is struggling with the meaning of his life, and trying to understand why the country he loves has changed so much. The novel is a portrait of a person and of our society. Quick explores the ways in which it becomes necessary to reconcile ourselves with the past and let go of burdens that have been carried far too long.<br /><br />Rating: Four-star (I like it);1505768105259;Portrait;AG473D27NAWRW3N2RMWVYZ6ICBTA;False

One of the most shameful things the Confederacy did was assassinate almost an entire company of North Carolinians simply because they chose to fight for the Union.

I'd like to see a decent book on another disgusting and almost forgotten incident, the Union POWs used as human shields by the CSA in Charleston SC.

You can tell that it's written by talented, experienced writer.And I realize that since I was reading this book in English, I can't praise the language use in full.<br />  Most likely,  you already know the plot if you've read more than one review on Amazon. I will not repeat it . The plot was unusual, but pretty interesting in the beginning. I wanted to know how the love story would develop. But as the story and novel went further, I was getting frustrated with the author. It seemed that he developed three absolutely different characters, fell in love with each of them and desperately wanted them to like each other as well. I would still agree on the fact that friendship duo Ilan+Avram sounded fun. But Ora (the girl they both supposedly loved) - I just couldn't relate to her or as the matter of fact, I could not feel the connection between Ora nad the boys.at all. And when I finally got to the point where everything in this book was centered around her, I almost quit.<br />  You don't have  to like every main character of the book you are reading, in order to enjoy the novel, but I would really appreciate if the author left me a choice-at least one more active ""person"" besides Ora that I could get to know and, maybe, like more than I liked her. Unfortunately I felt left alone with this women for a long 500 pages. I hated the fact that everyone in the book was so less important to the author , than Ora.. And as much as I pitied this woman , I couldn't hep but think how annoying she was. And it wasn't just me, who noticed. Her children and Ilan eventually grew tired of her. And it's a cruel thing to say, since I realize that raising kids, knowing that one day they will be gone to the war must be really devastating.<br />  Even though the part of the story when her children where little was very sweet and moving, Oras' constant presence and concentration on every detail is unbearable.<br />  There are many good, beautifully told aspects of this story. I don't mind long books, and this one could become one of my favorite. I learned a lot about Israel from The End of The Land and about parents' fears and struggle with the reality of life.

Here are my big questions:<br />1. Does every murderer need to be from a serial killer? Don't murderers only ever commit one murder?<br />2. Why would murderers always feel driven to have the same initials? (She has used this over and over and over again.)<br />3. Why are pocket PC's completely untraceable?<br />4. Do we need another mystery where a parent is urging a child to commit a massive murder? (She's done several already!)<br />5. Does every crime have to relate to Eve's past, Eve's dad, and Marlena? Will something new ever happen to Eve and Roarke?<br /><br />Now, the good parts of this novel?<br />1. Eve actually invited Louise over and played the matron of honor OK. She even dropped by Louise's for more than a medical consult.<br />2. We see Jaime in college, so he's still around and getting ready to join the police force.<br />3. We don't have any arguments about Roarke working on the case--as he's practically an adjunct member of the e-squad.<br /><br />The language (and use of the F word) was everywhere in this book. Even the 90 year old grandma was dropping the F-bomb. It's a bit over-the-top for me at this point. It's just too much language. The crimes are also much more savage, and the motive this time was really weak. The only way I'd have bought the murderer's motive is if the child had been dropped on his head as a small child.<br /><br />The theme is also repetitive: We are more than a product of what are parents tried to make us... But the murderer in this book isn't! Like Steve Audrey in Sommerset's mystery, the murderer has been groomed and persuaded to murder because a parent encourages the retribution. This isn't ""normal"" for murderers in ""real-life."" BTK and Unibomber each had normal families, normal siblings, and weren't groomed to become serial killers by their mother or their father!<br /><br />I guess I'm ready for Eve to move past the father/mother/mold/made conflict and ready to embrace something less repetitive. I'll buy the next book---as I'm madly in love with Roarke and Eve---but I'm ready for something new. The old is just old for me. If CSI can find two new crimes each week (and in Las Vegas, New York, and Miami!)

I have read a good many of Shakespeare's plays, including ""Othello,"" but you don't need to have previous Shakespearean knowledge in order to enjoy this novel (although it does intensify one's jollies). While ""King Lear"" has always been my own personal favorite Shakespeare play, I have also always held a certain curiosity when it comes to Iago. As villains go, Iago has always been considered one of the worst in Shakespeare's canon (in fact, THE worst by many scholars). This is largely due to the fact that within the context of the play, the reader has no idea what is driving Iago's depravity. Iago seems to be a character who is evil for the sake of being evil...and those people/characters are always the most dangerous. Given this information, it was exceptionally entertaining to read Galland's novel and get Iago's back story (which is told with bite, humor, and wit). In some ways the novel made me feel like a co-conspirator as I chuckled along. If you're a Shakespeare fan, I don't know if this will change your opinion on whether or not Iago is merely an evil fiend, but you'll certainly get some giggles. If you've never had the chance or inclination to read Shakespeare, maybe give this book a go, it might spark your interest in Shakespeare a bit.";1337827028000;Intelligently Entertaining;AE2MFGM2XOBPOQDSPWJLTSA54Z4Q;False

The authors do a brilliant job of summarizing the ideas of each philosopher or theologian, and showing how these ideas advanced the forms of both religion and government. The evolution of western civilization is explained for all to see. While Ireland is only one of the elements in the story, it provided a critical idea that transformed early religion, and led to all that followed. Because Ireland was never a part of the Roman Empire, and escaped being converted to the Roman religion for an extended period, It was the breeding grounds for concepts that shook the Roman Church to its foundations.

This is a pretty decent debut novel, but it's *definitely * YA, and, I'd guess, of no great interest to most readers over 20. GODS is written in broad, obvious strokes, and marred by a slow start, some PC preachiness and a particularly silly explosive-psi plot-device. Still, once it gets moving, it's an OK action-adventure written with some subtlety, and has some well-drawn characters.

0967313805;1;0967313805;5.0;The main thing I noticed about this book was that its author repeatedly emphasized how great stocks were.  He said that if you do it right and study the company, its earnings, and dividend payoffs (instead of the stock price) you'll pick good companies to invest in.  After that you'll hold onto the stock for years and years and years, and if you have enough diversification in your portfolio, you'll be sitting pretty in the long term.  This book is all about long term investing, and that's why I like it so much.<br /><br />In addition to promoting the safety of stock investing (if you pick them right and diversify correctly) the author also mentions that bonds aren't all they're cracked up to be.  Because of callback features on many of them, it's a lose-lose situation.  I think the author suggests something like an 80% stock and 20% bond portfolio ideally, unless you're squeamish about day to day fluctuations.<br /><br />The intended audience for this book seems to be a more wealthy crowd than the average joe.  Most people can't afford a completely diversified stock portfolio, so they have to pick a mutual fund that will choose stocks the way stocks are chosen in this book.  That just takes research and help from a reliable financial advisor with a very satisfied clientele.<br /><br />This book doesn't promise any short term gains and suggests that any books that do are full of bunk.  There's no way you'll predict the next huge upsurge in the market.  You still have to work your whole life and invest over years and years.  That's reality.<br /><br />The main feature of this book is its surprising emphasis on the relative safety of stocks, as long as you follow the procedures the author suggests and don't sell unless there are problems with the company.  I agree with his plan.  The problem is you need a lot of capital to implement it and unless you have a lot of time on your hands, you'll need a good financial advisor you can trust to help you along the way.;1134752704000;How risky are stocks?;AFCRLM7JHZRTWWXQXGCF3AT4M6AQ;False

With saying that, I Zombie was definitely not your typical zombie story at all. I want to say it reminded me a little bit of Warm Bodies only in that it is told from the zombies point of view instead of the survivors point of view. I just found this to be completely original because it followed these characters on their &#34;turning&#34; journey from start to finish and everything in between. I also found this read to be very &#34;realistic&#34; (well as realistic as a zombie apocalypse can be) because the author wasn't afraid to kill off characters, both good and bad. So you know what that's means: UGLY CRYING! I do have a small complaint and that is that I found the story to be a bit rushed, everything happened very fast or seemed like it.

While this effort does not come close to being in the same league as that book, it is quite a good, stimulating read.

0440226856;1;0440226856;3.0;"Beware!  Possible spoilers.<br /><br /> Holly Campbell on the outs with her police detective father.  It was his and her mother’s wedding anniversary, and he’s stood up a member of his family again for a case.  And he’s done it again without even bothering to call home and let anybody know he’s too busy for his family.<br /><br /> The problem is when he finally gets home, Holly lights into him and lets him know that he has made her mother cry, again.  Then her father drops a bomb on her world.  It turns out that her father’s latest cast is the investigation of the double murder of the parents of Cody, her boyfriend.<br /><br /> Holly then takes great offense that Cody, who can’t be found, is being treated like a suspect by her father and the police.  And then her father ends up getting upset that Holly is getting so upset.<br /><br /> Then, out of the blue, Cody shows up outside his house after a trip back from his parent’s lakeside cabin, and his parent’s deaths is something that comes as news to him.<br /><br /> Still feeling that Cody is being picked on, and that nobody is giving him a fair shake, Holly constantly blows her stack, and decides that she’s gonna prove him innocent no matter what it takes.<br /><br /> But her father eventually gets so upset with Holly’s head-strong and stubborn impetuousness, and her constant interference, that he forbids her to hang out with, or date, Cody.<br /><br /> During her obsessive interference and investigations, she comes into contact with Glenda Jordan, an eccentric woman who is a neighbor of Cody’s.  Holly met Glenda when Holly had asked her if they had seen anything on the night of the murder.<br /><br /> Glenda claims to be a clairvoyant, and offers to help Holly solve the murders, but, only if Holly can keep an open mind.<br /><br /> While I enjoyed “Spirit Seeker”, the mystery is pretty rudimentary, and the more the evidence builds up against Cody the more you realize that not only can’t he be the killer, but it becomes just as obvious who the killer really is.<br /><br /> And while a big deal is made out of there being a clairvoyant on the back cover, for all intents and purposes, the appearance of Glenda becomes nothing more than a red herring as her contribution to the solving of the mystery is next to nothing.<br /><br /> And as far as the characters are concerned, most of them are pretty unlikable.  Holly is loud, obnoxious, and annoying; her father’s is just unsympathetic and distant; Holly’s mother is just, well, there, etc.<br /><br /> All-in-all, this is one of Holly Lowery Nixon’s lesser and weaker novels, it’s well written, but I wouldn’t read it again.

0593085388;2;0593085388;4.0;The Twelve Dates of Christmas by Jenny Bayliss is a sweet holiday romcom about a woman done with casual flings and ready for either a serious relationship or to say she gave it a serious go and move on with her life. Kate Turner longs for what her two best friends have: a steady, reliable plus one and to start her own family. At this point in her life, she’s willing to go the family route alone if need be as there hasn’t been a guy to really catch her eye. At the urging of her friend, she reluctantly joins a twelve dates of Christmas event through a local online dating service. Thus ensues a story full of ups and downs, twists and turns, and hilarious blind dates that leaves Kate what-if-ing her own life choices.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book! It’s a cute story from start to finish, light-hearted and humorous at just the right spots while also hitting on some tough, emotional subjects. Kate is an easy character to empathize with and cheer on as she encounters each of her twelve dates. The cast of characters that support Kate and the main story is wonderful. I love her dad, Lauren, and Matt. They complement Kate and bring out sides that we wouldn’t see with just the dates. I also enjoyed the unique setup of the book. Each chapter is set around one of her twelve dates and focuses on the events leading up to and immediately after them. This gives us a chance to get to know Kate more than just surface level.<br /><br />My only gripe, and it’s a small one, is that I knew from the first few pages who Kate would wind up with. It’s fairly obvious even if Kate herself is oblivious to it. While it didn’t bother me to have figured it out so early on in the book, it did make for a less exciting read. I found myself frustrated with Kate and the love interest early on at how they avoided the elephant in the room while the entire town seemed to be routing them on in the background.<br /><br />Overall, The Twelve Dates of Christmas is exactly what you’d expect from any holiday romcom: sweet, cute, and an HEA. The setting of a small English village and the cast of characters really held my interest in Kate’s story. I did pick up the audiobook about a third of the way into the book, and I’m glad I did. Elizabeth Knowelden narrates, and I loved her tone and inflections for each character. It was easy to keep them straight and know who was talking without having to go back. If you enjoy romance, I highly recommend it.;1670518697920;Cute Holiday RomCom;AHCS74WXN77DZX4CC3RO7NQYKG6A;True

159474758X;10;159474758X;4.0;I was blown away by Ransom Riggs' Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, delighted by its dark aesthetic and art direction. I've been progressively less impressed with each installment in the series, which I tend to think of as less a reflection on Riggs' skill and more a testament to the difficulty of engineering a narrative to fit the publishing world's current demand for tripartite storytelling.<br /><br />The Library of Souls in particular shows the strain of its forced framework, with its sudden shift in the wights' endgame. That sea change gets explained, lamely, by saying that the goal previously stated was simply a cover story given to lower-ranking wights who might wind up getting interrogated and not the true Master Plan.<br /><br />As Scully once put it: Sure. Fine. Whatever. Because the plot isn't really the point here (clearly, since we end with a giant heaping helping of Deus ex Machina), so much as the opportunity for Riggs to craft creepy set pieces centered on vintage photos and gorgeously imagined alternate realities. If I'm a bit disappointed it's only because the first novel in particular managed to harness both story and tone so successfully.<br /><br />Library is a fun read, and gives a satisfying-enough conclusion to the saga of Miss Peregrine's Peculiars. But I can't help wonder what it might have been like if Jacob's tale hadn't been shoehorned into the trilogy format, and had been allowed to run its natural - or in this case peculiar - course.;1448655724000;Suffers from a case of trilogy-itis, but still a good read;AE7H55QA77GJTWG7GZCM4DP33UNQ;False

1497562589;0;1497562589;2.0;“The Tenderness of Mountains” was billed as a collection of poetry that dealt with themes of love and loss. It’s evident in her writing these themes are very precious to Miss Gabriel. I’m sorry she had to experience such pain with the passing of loved ones and I really hope that time heals all wounds. While I was able to pick up on her emotions of sadness, it was the language in which she wrote her poetry that was a deal breaker for me. She relies heavily on metaphors, so much so that there are times when I don’t know what the particular comparison is referring to. Yes, the themes of nature as it relates to love can be apparent in poetry, but I didn’t see the connection for myself.

It is a rare opportunity to grab a non-fiction read that is engaging from the start.  He brings to life these gentlemen in a manner others have not, and would not.  He reflects them as individuals facing the day to day challenges of the times they lived, not so unlike our own personal challenges today.

Was disappointing. Senseless battle after battle and repeats of stories you heard in the first book. None of the charm that made the first book interesting. Veilissar Farcarinon is barely in this book. It starts with the Endarkened attacking her coronation, she escapes and is not in the rest of the book. There are huge jumps in timeframe, a chapter ends and suddenly the main character is thinking about how it's been three years, five years, ten years since his hated Lifebonded Veilissar Farcarinon went over the mountains, but he still hates her and doesn't understand why she never came back. A LOT of the book is spent with him whining about how much he hates her and should just kill himself to kill her, but won't because now he has a little bit of a purpose... But he should still do it! The elves are all one note, all the same horrible people with no reason besides tradition, and most of the names are so long and so similar that it's really hard to keep up with which character is who.<br />There are just barely enough interesting notes based on what I know about the world from the other books that I finished it, but the best part of the previous book in this series was VF and she was completely absent from this one.<br />To top it all off, it has been nearly five years since this book came out (original publishing date is 2017) and the final book in the series isn't out yet! I suspect they have had trouble connecting the ends of the story to where it should be based on the Obsidian trilogy....

This book had great characters, a non-stop pace, and plenty of twists and turns to keep me interested.<br />The love triangle between Clara, Christian, and Tucker was painful at times.  It was hard to see Clara just drop Christian and see her fall headfirst for Tucker in only a few days.  I feel like the synopsis on Goodreads of Clara and Tucker's relationship is a little misleading- Tucker isn't evil, he isn't some bad boy, and he doesn't lead her to a path of horrible evil (or some other cliche).  I liked how Clara and Tucker interacted, and I have to say I loved how Clara didn't put up with Christian's behavior towards her and instead stood up for herself.<br /><br />This book is lighter.

I saw the movie and thought it was mediocre and I just assumed that the book would be likewise. After being urged by a friend to give this book a shot, I finally did and here I am finally reviewing this book which turned out to be a pleasant  surprise.<br /><br />By now, most of mankind knows the plot [(although the amusing thing is, there really isn't one :)]. Seconds before the Earth is destroyed, a human named Arthur Dent is plucked off the planet by his friend Ford Prefect. As it turns out, Prefect has been stranded on Earth for over 15 years, posing as an out-of-work actor while doing research for the revised edition of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.<br /><br />Dent and Prefect leave earth and begin to go on a intergalactic journey full of twists and turns while being picked up by the Heart of Gold, a ship which houses the might Improbability Drive that naturally helps transport them across galaxies faster than the speed of light. The rest of the characters include a two-headed, three-armed hippie who happens to be the president of the galaxy; Trillian, whom Arthur tried to pick up at a Earth cocktail party; and Marvin, a weary, depressed and highly intelligent robot.<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, there isn't a particularly deep plot to this book which is what makes it such a unique blend of sci-fi, comedy, and philosophy. Douglas Adams spares no expense in poking fun at science fiction and some of it's clichés such as asking  the menacing guards on alien ships if they are truly happy with their jobs and if not why don't they just quit and find another  profession? Of course, the deep philosophical questions of our existence are not spared by Adams either. Deep Thinker, a  supercomputer that takes a total of 7.5 million years to answer Life's greatest questions and then another 2.5 million years for its successor to come up with a question to the original answer, lol.<br /><br />As others have said, you don't even have to be a science-fiction fan to really appreciate this book. Just be prepared for some of the quirkiest and oddball comedy you've ever read!<br /><br />-Travis S";1312128030000;a pop culture classic :);AHB3RHUO4CKE4BOKMDNLQSC7MMXA;True

1590172434;3;1590172434;4.0;"I read this 1939 classic of British adventure writing as part of an occasional quest to revisit some of the books that were popular in my childhood. Or in this case, to visit for the first time, since although I had often heard of Household's book, I had never read it. It was a particular pleasure to do so in this beautiful NYRB reprint, with its splendidly evocative cover. Alongside the pleasant confirmation of a familiar world, it brought me an almost equal measure of disappointment and delighted surprise. Let me explain.<br /><br />The book was familiar because of its place in the family tree of spy/adventure stories with such ancestors as RL Stevenson's [[ASIN:0141326026 KIDNAPPED]], Erskine Childers' [[ASIN:184022178X THE RIDDLE OF THE SANDS]], and the John Buchan series beginning with [[ASIN:0199537879 THE THIRTY NINE STEPS]]. The hero is typically an upper-class Briton possessed of independent means, an enquiring mind, and certain outdoor skills which he uses to great advantage. Household's nameless protagonist is even more independent, less a party man, more strikingly inventive. As a reviewer quoted on the cover suggests, the lineage to Frederick Forsyth's [[ASIN:0553266306 THE DAY OF THE JACKAL]] or (crossing the Atlantic) Stephen Hunter's [[ASIN:0553563513 POINT OF IMPACT]] is clear.<br /><br />The novel also took me to the vanishing countryside of my birth. Although it opens with the hero in an unnamed European state, stalking its leader (obviously Hitler, but note that this was written before the war) with a telescopic rifle, just as a sportsman's challenge to prove it can be done, most of it takes place in the fields and hedgerows of rural England. At the start of the book, the hero has already been captured and tortured, and survived an ""accidental"" death. He escapes to England, but finds himself pursued there also, and has to go to ground -- literally so, living for weeks in a burrow converted from an animal's earth. The spy-story elements at the start of the book soon give way to the situation of hunter and hunted each trying to use their knowledge of the countryside to outwit the other.<br /><br />Hence both my disappointment and my surprise. Although the protagonist will reveal more complex and believable motives later, you have to accept his initial exploit at face value, and moreover to agree with him that he cannot simply seek police protection when he gets to London. On the plot level, the book is thin. Yet what I had not imagined at all, and what intrigued me immensely, is that once all the spy and counterspy business drops away, one is left with a novel that comes as close to later Existentialism as to earlier adventure stories. As the interest focuses on the man living like an animal and virtually becoming one, it raises deep questions of humanity and ethics, so much so that it is almost a pity to see it turn back into a spy novel again for the finale -- though even that ends with a curious ambiguity that is as satisfying as it was unexpected.";1272751153000;The Hunter Hunted;AGCWDKIATRJJB7QSRKWICHCKWQHQ;True
0670022357;6;0670022357;3.0;If forced to choose, Stewart O'Nan may very well be my favorite writer. so, having read all but two of O'Nan's novels (one being Wish You Were Here, which I'll be skipping), i think the man's a literary giant. but this book is not a giant, and it isn't meant to to be. it's O'Nan writing something for himself, almost on a dare, it seems: can i make a story concerning the day-to-day life and the introspective rememberances of an elderly woman living alone work? it's a book a literary lion who's penned 12 novels can get away with. there's a lot i admire here. but there's a lot i don't. it's not compelling. Emily's life just doesn't make interesting fiction, or O'Nan couldn't make it so, like he did with Manny in Lobster, like Patty in The Good Wife. i can't explain why the less plot-driven Lobster, Good Wife, and Everyday People worked for me and this one didn't. i just simply found Emily, Alone wanting and underwhelming. in avoiding melodrama and sentimentality, O'Nan manages to just miss poignance, revelation, and resonance. it's so well-written, per usual, and it has its moments to be sure, but for me there's no necessary tension required of longform fiction, character study or no. i didn't hate it, but i didn't love it like all his others.

0393321800;3;0393321800;4.0;"I'm embarking on reading a selection of ""In Search of Lost Time"" and I decided to get some help before I start.  Roger Shattuck was an eminent Proust scholar having studied and written about him for many years.  He was also the author of ""The Banquet Years"" one of my favorite books about the avante garde in France.<br /><br />This book was extremely helpful in providing an overview of the plot, main characters and themes but this is what you get in any Cliff notes on the novel.  While delivering on those basics and using that as a framework, Shattuck goes much deeper.  He provides a key insight not just about Proust's masterpiece but the role of literature itself.  Proust, Shattuck believes, sees literature as serving as a heightened canvas on which the stuff of life is tackled and mediated in order to make life itself reflective of things we are too close to see without the aid of literature.<br /><br />Proust has often been accused of being an aesthete without any practical appreciate for daily life.  Shattuck makes the point that Proust objected to such a role for himself as a writer.  His concerns were all about daily life, the jealousies, the snobbery, the matters of the heart.<br /><br />The other thing that Shattuck points out is that the novels length is itself a comment of the passage of time.  Through the experience of reading the 3,000 page novel you pass through your own sense of time with these characters and earn a reader's wisdom about lives lived.  This book made me eager to read the entirety of ""In Search of Lost Time"" but let me tackle ""Swann's Way"" first and I'll see if my enthusiasm holds up!<br /><br />My only caveat concerning the book is that it's a more compilation of material Professor Shattuck prepared elsewhere then a book written specifically for the subject.  There is a section called, ""continuing disputes"" that only an academic would love.  Still, the book is well worth having.";1417486540000;Help with Proust;AG6BMNG2JMPL5MLSBPNG42TL3XAQ;False

Miss Fawlthorne welcomes Flavia to Miss Bodycote's Female Academy. Flavia is shown to her room, the Edith Cavell room. All is so strange and indifferent to Flavia that is until as she strolls the halls of the Academy she comes across the framed portraits of former students that have since passed. And Flavia stops by the portrait of her Mother, Harriet. One familiar face.<br /><br />Flavia may have been out of England and away from Buskshaw and Gladys and her beloved Duggar, but she was still Flavia in every sense.<br /><br />Another excellent entry in the Flavia de Luce series.

0425128164;3;0425128164;2.0;The writing in this book was mediocre, though it was easy to get through it. That was a plus. I never would have finished it if it hadn't been as quick paced and it was. The real problem I had with the story was with the character of Roy. The way Koontz presents him, I would call him a sociopath. He has so many of the characteristics of one, most notably the charm. But Koontz then goes and blames his antisocial behavior on childhood trauma. I can understand why he would do that, since it is recommended to make even your villains sympathetic. But as someone interested both in characterization and psychology, I had a hard time melding the character presented to me and the idea that he was created by trauma. If trauma was the cause, I would imagine Roy as a very different person. Certainly lacking the charm that was key to his character. Koontz did a good job of providing us with a sociopathic character, that it was disappointing that he didn't develop that. And I had a hard time imagining the trauma that Roy suffered causing his particular brand of antisocial behavior. Probably most people wouldn't care about this, but it prevented me from getting properly absorbed in the book.;1249433813000;So-so;AGQWUJ7PP7LHOXPH4RGO3UXSGWVQ;False
160684038X;5;160684038X;2.0;The book's plot is not very well thought-out. I found myself confused for much of the story, and there is little background on the world they live in. Plot aside, the characters are not believable at all. There's a very weak love triangle between Sydelle, Wayland, and Henryl actually, it's not really a love triangle at all, since Henry pretty much throws in the towel as soon as he sees Wayland. Sydelle is wishy-washy, and her changing feelings toward Wayland is hard to imagine. Wayland is an annoying drunkard, and it is hard to see what Sydelle sees in him. His coming to care for Sydelle is unrealistic, and I was completely unconvinced about their romance.<br /><br />To sum it up: potentially good plot, but poorly planned out. Annoying hero.

0316182281;12;0316182281;5.0;"Greg Rucka is one of the most creative and readable authors working today.  His stand alones are often great and I love his Atticus Kodiak series--which are too infrequent for my desires.  But in ""Alpha"", Rucka is apparently debuting a new series character named ""Jad"" Bell, former Delta, who now hires out for cause and country.  Based on this initial effort, Bell is a character well worth watching (reading) in that he is highly trained, intuitive, conflicted with a still unclear back story, and very deadly.  He leads a team of four former co-warriors, each with skills and training that make them a most formidable foe.<br /><br />Rucka has a knack for seizing on some element of everyday life around which to build his thrillers and in ""Alpha"", that practice is continued as Wilsonville, the world's largest theme park located in Southern California--think Disneyland on steroids--comes under an apparent terrorist attack.  Jad Bell along with one of his team members is working undercover in the park as secret governmental leaders are covering several theme parks as possible targets for a rumored terrorist attack.  A sleeper agent has been ""awakened"" to plant a dirty bomb in Wilsonville at the height of summer attendance, capture some hostages, and issue vague demands for release of world terrorist prisoners.  But as Bell springs into action, he wonders if this is the real end game or if something even more sinister is afoot?<br /><br />Oh, and you want complications?  How about the fact that Bell's former wife, their hearing impaired daughter, and her deaf classmates are in the park and become hostages by the terrorists.  The evolution of Bell's character as this deadly warrior has to deal with familial roadblocks is fascinating reading. Another complication is the question of who is financing this enterprise and who, on the inside, is actually a part of the scheme? Rucka employs twists, double crosses, and sleight of hand to keep readers wondering who really is who they say they are and who really trusts whom--among both the good guys and the bad guys. With continual impressive chess-like maneuvering between Bell and his deadly antagonist, readers must speculate as to who will ultimately survive on both sides of this conflict.<br /><br />Rucka is an adept story teller who employs tight plotting and fast precise pacing to build a sense of relentless suspense and tension.  His knowledge of weaponry and military tactics and strategy gives a level of authenticity to his books as does his highly believable dialogue and characterizations.  His characters, both good and bad, become invested in the reader as Rucka fleshes them with just enough back story to keep readers interested yet withholding detail that will emerge in future stories.  I highly recommend ""Alpha"" to readers of the suspense/thriller genre and I welcome the new character of Jad Bell to what I hope is a long productive series by Greg Rucka.";1339948780000;Rucka Grabs You On Page One And Never Lets Go;AGUC77RC74K7T2EZL3ICLZ25HFQA;True

0224079913;8;0224079913;3.0;SHENZHEN, animator Guy Delisle's follow-up to the wonderful PYONGYANG, is an enjoyable and quick read about a city probably quite unfamiliar to many in the West.  Shenzhen China is one of a number of free enterprise zones set up by the Chinese government and Delisle's three month stint there provides us a glimpse into local customs, the Chinese mentality and, most noteworthy in this book, the culture shock and isolation that this can produce.<br /><br />There is a big issue right off the bat with SHENZHEN.  No doubt many were first introduced to Delisle through PYONGYANG and, the fact is, Shenzhen China simply is not as interesting a place.  Pyongyang, after all, is the capital city of the most psychotic and paranoid regime on the planet, where propoganda about the country's leader is a constant companion.  There is nothing similar in Shenzhen and, indeed, the single biggest feeling of the book is isolation and boredom.  Although the reader can appreciate those feelings through Delisle's writing and drawings, it produces a far different, and less interesting book.<br /><br />Let us keep in mind, though, that this is a graphic novel.  It is not like one needs the same amount of time to get through it as, say, WAR AND PEACE.  The book is light-hearted, interesting (even if less so than his previous book) and provides Westerners a quick snapshot into a foreign culture that most of us will not experience firsthand.

Oliver is the elderly (92), almost mythical southern historian that young (29) Cameron has worked for, as aide and companion, for a few years.  His relationship with Cameron is more than friend and mentor; he becomes her conscience.  His bequest to Cameron is a package that she is required to deliver to her former best friend, Sonia.  There has been a significant rift in the friendship of Cameron and Sonia, which Sonia has attempted to repair with a letter, telling Cameron of her upcoming marriage, and wondering if they will ever meet again.<br /><br />Cameron's not seen Sonia for 8 years, and in their memorable last time together, Cameron left Sonia stranded in a gasoline station rest room in the middle of west Texas.  The act was payback for Sonia's admission of an act of betrayal.  This act of betrayal initially is too jarring for Cameron to react to....but eventually the anger and the dishonesty of Sonia's act is too much for her, and she acts out her anguish.  Heavy on her conscience is her own love for the young man who had wooed Sonia in high school, and Cameron's steely will that insures she will not profess the love, because the friendship is too important to her.  Indeed, both young women have suffered through difficult adolescence; Cameron's family is military and nomadic, and she has difficulty making friends.  Sonia suffers from dyscalcula, a crippling learning disability, and the shame she bears from her mother's alarming reaction to the flaw.<br /><br />We don't find out what caused Cameron's act until ""The Myth of You and Me"", by author Leah Stewart, has introduced us to Cameron's current world, and taken us back to scenes of Cameron and Sonia's friendship as adolescents and throughout college.  Timing of her revelations in the novel is very much on author Stewart's side; indeed, her prose strolls out at you for chapters, captures you in the relationship of the two young women, makes you remember your own special relationships with close girlfriends, and then shatters the myth.<br /><br />In the eventual reunion, Stewart maintains the story's complexity and keeps the action character driven.  There is no immediate happy ending.  Instead we are left, particularly those of us who are female, with a tale that we can't resist - a tale of the irresistable bonding in women's friendships, the caring, the struggles, the acts of kindness and the feelings of loss.

What a great collection of stories, it comprises over the behind the scenes of creating this film. The book is consists of 10 chapters with a forward done by Wil Wheaton and Eugene Bergmann. The book's illustrations are even done by (Randy) Ian Petrella! Without giving anything away the 10 chapters are:<br /><br />  -The Ten-Year Itch- Background and script writing information on Bob Clark and Jean Shepard as well as how the cast got their parts<br /><br />  -Atop Mighty Mount Olympus- Awesome story on how Patty Johnson (head elf at Higbee's) got her part for the movie<br /><br />  -St. Catharine's and the No-Show Snow- Stories from when the movie was filming in St. Catherine's, Ontario at the Victoria Public School. (Shocked about where the Directors Cut ended up!)<br /><br />  -Indiana, Canada- Information on the deleted scenes from the film as well as more stories from filming on set<br /><br />  -Reconstructing Christmas- The rise of the films popularity over the past 30 years with updates from cast members<br /><br />  -Explorers Road Trip for Ralphie- Recap of Tyler and Jordie Schwartz's Road trip for Ralphie Documentary. (The costume story blows my mind!!)<br /><br />  -This Little Piggy Came Home- Ian Petrella's (Randy) story about coming back to A Christmas Story House and Museum. (Some very funny stories from Ian!)<br /><br />  -Zack the Bully, Toady. and Nameless Victim- Updates on Zack Ward (Scut Farkus) and Scott Schwartz (Flick) as well as legal battles Zack had over merchandising.<br /><br />  -Applauding the Geniuses on Cleveland Street- Discusses A Christmas Story in the media today. Plays, Musicals and what Peter Billingsley (Ralphie) is up to<br /><br />  -The Shark and the Real Turkey- Information on sequels and other previous films about the Parker Family<br /><br />As a huge fan of A Christmas Story I thought I knew most of the behind the scenes stories, but I was surprised on how much I did not know. Caseen really outdid himself with finding the onset stories and cast interviews, giving their thoughts about the movie. The book is over 180 pages, with never before seen color photographs from behind the scenes on set. This is worth the purchase alone!

1479840823;7;1479840823;5.0;"We are mammals, and so by definition we have hair.  We aren’t the only mammals who groom ourselves, but we are the only ones who remove our hair with such resolve.  We have used razors made of clamshells or of stainless steel, tweezers, wax, lasers, electrolysis, and chemicals.  Such multifaceted resolve in any other arena would be a fit subject for academic study, but hair removal?  In her introduction to _Plucked: A History of Hair Removal_ (New York University Press), historian Rebecca M. Herzig writes, “The whole topic of body hair, I have learned, strikes many people as not merely tedious but also uncouth, even downright repulsive.  Several previous reviewers of this work suggested that hair removal is simply too repellent to merit scholarly attention.”  She says that a famous sociologist, when he asked her what she was working on, upon hearing the reply, turned his chair away and huffed, “Well, I suppose everyone has to work on something.”  It’s a good thing Herzig ignored the criticisms; her book is full of pertinent and odd findings, and although it has plenty of references and footnotes, it is funny and entertaining.<br /><br />This is mostly a story of women and their body hair.  Hair on women’s legs and faces meant something, although the newly-designated sexologists around the turn of the last century disagreed on what.  Hairy women (and somehow not men) were throwbacks to some primitive forebear; ideas like this were harnessed to promote commercial hair removal.  Some of the methods of hair removal discussed here were brutal, and even deadly.  “Punching,” for instance, involved a tiny cylindrical knife jammed through the skin around the shaft of a hair.  “Punching,” deadpans Herzig, “was never a particularly popular method of hair removal.”  Removing hairs from animal carcasses was a bottleneck process in butchering, until alkalis, soda ash, arsenic, and more were used to dissolve the hair.  It wasn’t long after that such chemicals were tried on women.  Commercial versions came out, and some were so caustic that they took skin away with hairs.  Medical journals included stories of the lethality of such preparations.  Some contained deadly thallium.  Dangerous depilatory creams were one of the reasons the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 was passed.  There were X-ray removal techniques; in the early twentieth century, physicians stopped using them and commercial practitioners caught onto the boon.  There were hundreds of such x-ray clinics, all bragging about how scientific they were.  When eventually such clinics were outlawed, there were back-alley versions.  Waxes became popular after World War I, and there are now thousands of waxes available, many of which are based on petroleum waste and do not have to be extensively tested since they are not swallowed.  Some people consider laser treatment the gold standard; the laser light is absorbed by the hair bulb, is converted to heat, and the heat destroys the bulb.  It sounds simple, but it is far from painless, and some clinics offer pre-laser lidocaine or intravenous sedatives.  Physicians who offered laser hair removal do so at least in part because it is a cash-only business, not covered by insurance or health maintenance organizations.<br /><br />Herzig draws from history, sociology, racial studies, anthropology, and dermatology, and has absorbed views of theologians and pornographers.  Much of what she has found is disturbing, and other findings are just funny, illustrating what a peculiar set of mammals we are.  A depression-era ad quoted here said, “Freedom from Unwanted Hair Opens the Gates to Social Enjoyments That Are Forever Closed to Those So Afflicted.”  Onward and forever: Freedom.";1424963988000;Hair Razing;AFXCVVIZKGYX4MMEL2AVY5ZGCZQQ;False

B000B9MZVC;1;B000B9MZVC;4.0;"The original title of this early Arthur C. Clarke novel, which he wrote in 1947 but did not find a publisher for until 1950, was &#34;Prelude to Space.&#34; The 1961 Lancer paperback edition was entitled &#34;Master of Space,&#34; presumably just to use the front-cover tagline &#34;The sensational science-fiction bestseller that could make our U.S. astronaut 'Master of Space.'&#34; Ignoring the question of how a book could make an astronaut &#34;master&#34; of anything, the original title was much more fitting, because none of the story (except the last four pages) takes place in space.<br /><br />When &#34;Prelude to Space&#34; came out, World War II was barely over. Human spaceflight was still an unimaginably distant dream (except for a few dedicated visionaries such as Wernher von Braun and Sergei Korolev), and only a handful of scientists and engineers knew anything at all about space or what it would take to explore the hostile environment. Certainly the &#34;man in the street&#34; knew nothing whatsoever about spaceflight technology, human or otherwise.<br /><br />&#34;Prelude to Space&#34; is just what the doctor ordered--an elementary primer on the topic.<br /><br />Using the tried-and-true technique of an &#34;outsider&#34; character, in this case historian/reporter Dirk Alexson, who is utterly ignorant about the subject at hand and thus has to have everything explained to him in monosyllabic terms, Mr. Clarke elucidates many key concepts of rocketry and space travel in highly readable, understandable fashion, and always with the impeccable scientific accuracy to be expected from an author of his background and stature.<br /><br />Today's readers will find the book hopelessly dated, of course. No nation ever developed a Sanger-style, rail-launched, two-stage, winged vehicle such as Mr. Clarke envisions--and the nuclear rocket engine that he describes in intimate detail is as yet, and likely will forever be, unrealized. Still, recalling that Mr. Clarke wrote &#34;Master of Space&#34; 10 years before the Soviet Union launched the first artificial earth satellite, the book is remarkable for the breadth and depth of its educational scope.<br /><br />Unabashedly British in plot, tone and characters (even the putatively American Alexson speaks in British slang--I suspect Mr. Clarke simply was not familiar with U.S. &#34;English&#34; idioms at the time), &#34;Master of Space&#34; is an interesting look at the nascent field of space technology from almost 70 years ago. The story is mostly well-paced, although it does drag a bit in places, and some of the dialogue is stilted and unrealistic, but the book's value as a historical document overrides its few forgiveable shortcomings. Mr. Clarke had not yet earned his full reputation as perhaps the world's foremost science/science fiction author when he wrote this book, but he was well on his way to the top.<br /><br />The rest, as they say, is history.";1435158645000;An Earthbound Spaceflight Book;AGLGX7DGPF5AUXRUA3OPADMXGPRA;False

Clarke is quick to forgive herself but not so quick to fully forgive others. This is obviously a deeply personal and emotional memoir of her own reunion with her birth mother and her integration into a family she already knew. I found it hard to relate to either of them. Conversations are related verbatim as though the author took detailed notes from the first one. As a reader I wondered if she did - if in the back of her mind through her reunion was that this might be a good memoir one day. Clarke has respectfully waited to tell her tale until most of the principal parties are gone, but the book still feels intrusive. The best memoirs make you live a moment in the authors life and wish you could stay longer. While Clarke is a talented writer who excels at illustrating her emotions I struggled to stay with her story.;1399526919000;Famous Daughter Meets Famous Mother;AHMHWEOJAQ3F37Q2R2DQCX4JLDSA;False
0385342608;1;0385342608;5.0;I went back and forth between a 4 and 5 star rating for this book. Samuelsson and his editors have put together an exceptionally well done memoir. Where Yes Chef slips is in it's timeline - there are moments where the book jumps around in his life and career. It works, but it does throw the reader out of the story while you figure out exactly where in Samuelsson's life events are occurring. putting it back into 5 stars for me is the honesty with which Samuelsson approaches his life. he has always made the choice that would lead him to the place he is in his career, no matter what had to be sacrificed along the way. As a reader, I appreciated his open assessment of his life to this point. Giving a glimpse into the apprenticeship program of the aspiring chef, the author shares what it is like to be an immigrant from multiple countries and multiple families while still maintaining his focus. He is honest about the toll his ambition has taken on his body and his family, but not himself. I felt that Samuelsson still has several unexplored areas within himself, areas he is setting aside while he continues to focus on his goals. Having broken down racial barriers Samuelsson faces the personal barriers still in front of him with a clear eye to his own failings. Choosing gratitude over grief, he works to help others rise to his level. It is a complex portrait of a complex man and one I am glad to have read. While he talks food in Yes Chef, it seems almost like a fall back, a move to a place he is more comfortable in. This is really a coming of age story and one that will appeal to foodies and non-foodies equally.;1337796091000;Hard Work & Hard Choices;AHMHWEOJAQ3F37Q2R2DQCX4JLDSA;False

(although some of them are amusing and/or tragic)The mood of the narrative shifts not only between narrative viewpoints but in mood - sometimes the book is funny, sometimes grim, sometimes absurd a la Kafka or Orwell.

0806518871;5;0806518871;5.0;"This is, quite simply, the best Wicca 101 book alongside Cunningham's ""Wicca for the Solitary"". While the latter book goes into more ritual detail, ""21st Century Wicca"" discusses everyday life as a Wiccan.<br /><br />There are some ritual ideas and basic info in this book, but where it really shines is with the personal testimony and the attention Hunter gives to what it's like to be a Wiccan in the ""real world"". She goes over things that a lot of high school and college-aged Wiccans (who make up the bulk of the 101 crowd) are concerned with, such as whether or not to find a group, the virtues of self-initiation, and coming out of the broom closet.<br /><br />It's an exceptionally realistic look, without going into persecution complexes. The added quotes from people who have been practicing pagan ways for varying amounts of time just makes the book that much more valuable, showing the reader that it really *is* a very individual path and there's no single ""right"" way to do things.<br /><br />All in all, I think that if you have to give a book to a younger newbie (or if you are that younger newbie) this is it!

Story is about The Whittiers, a large, loving family coming together after the tragic accidental death of their parents. There are six siblings who are a wide range in age, at various stages in their personal lives and careers. Some are married, single, twins, one is on the spectrum, one is secretly gay, and a wild child. There will be romance and new love, divorce, secrets revealed and life changing surprises. They all realize how much their Mom handled every day and miss her wisdom. The parents had remained very deeply in love.  Their retired parents left the family home to all the children assuming they would sell and divide the proceeds. Events transpire resulting in some of the eldest moving back home. The estate needs to be settled and they can’t agree to sell immediately. Further developments change opinions as some of the siblings circumstances change. The new directions their lives take brings them closer together as a new, ever growing family unit. They are all kind, good people learning to grieve and heal.<br /><br />Thanks to Netgalley and Random House Publishing Group-Ballantine;1669128201777;Family;AGWMQEPHCO2HTPNZBLGWG2F5ZC5A;False

0978629302;1;0978629302;4.0;"The people in Washington have decided that growing corn to produce ethanol as a partial means to energy independence is consistent with national security goals.  Consequently ethanol production, like domestic oil production receives government subsidies.  Some may call it pork-barrel legislation and others may call it a ""scam.""  Robert Bryce, in his recently published Gusher of Lies: The Dangerous Delusion of Energy Independence (2008), actually entitles his chapter on ethanol, ""The Ethanol Scam.""  Bryce's point is that ethanol production is not energy efficient and is not sustainable.  Furthermore it is posited that we should be using our cropland to grow food for a hungry world that is likely to get hungrier.<br /><br />Jeffrey Goettemoeller and Adrian Goettemoeller argue in this technical but readable book that ethanol production can be made energy efficient and sustainable.  They counter the cropland for food argument by noting that only the carbohydrate component of the corn kernel is used to produce ethanol, adding that too much corn is now grown for food in America to the detriment of farmers elsewhere who cannot compete in the marketplace with cheap American corn.  Consequently, our abundance puts small foreign farmers out of business and ironically creates food shortages.  See pages 86-87 for the full argument.<br /><br />As to the viability of ethanol for use in our vehicles, the authors contend that, although ethanol is only about two-thirds as energy rich as gasoline, it is nonetheless necessary since we will soon or late run out of gasoline.  Furthermore, today's combustion engines can be altered to run more efficiently on ethanol than currently is the case.  (See ""flex fuel"" vehicles.)  Additionally, ethanol is valuable since burning it reduces vehicular pollution.  Finally, ethanol is a necessary replacement for MTBE which here in California has been phased out due to its tendency to pollute underground water supplies.<br /><br />The book begins with a brief but interesting history of ethanol production, how it was used in lamps before electricity, and how it was legislated against during Prohibition.  They follow that with a consideration of oil production and consumption and the prospects for the return of cheap oil.  They go on to tout the economic and security benefits of ethanol while considering the environmental impact.  Fuel economy and the various gasoline/ethanol blends are discussed and how ethanol might improve fuel economy.  There's a chapter on ethanol production from such feedstocks as sorghum, sugar, artichokes, and food waste.  Cellulosic ethanol is considered.  They close by urging conservation and more efficient use of fuel.<br /><br />My personal opinion is that ethanol is one of many stop-gap measures we will be taking during the long, slow withdrawal from fossil fuels.  In the final analysis, unless there are some major breakthroughs in more efficient ways to capture solar energy and the development of more efficient batteries to store energy, we will not be able to support the six and a half billion people on this planet at current energy levels.";1208024778000;Excellent primer on the ethanol industry;AFNKPUJHXI62LMB2U7OAWC7ICUXA;False

I was pleased to discover this offering was a lighter course than her first two brilliant novels, ""Rosewater Creek"" and ""Cold Rock River.""<br /><br />The protagonist, Andi(Andrea) St. James is thirteen old and resides in an affluent neighborhood of Atlanta.  On the outside it looks beautiful, but inside events  quagmire Andi into confusion and anger.  When her beloved older brother, Alex, is killed in a college initiation hazing, the tight-knit family begins to unravel.  Mother has a serious drinking problem and Father is copulating with the next door neighbor's young wife.  Her sister, Beth, a 22 year old beauty is dumped at the alter but seemingly undisturbed by it. Alex's ex-fiancé discovers she pregnant and not having an easy time.  Though all these problems could be morose, Miles deftly handles it with the optimism Andi can't help but exude.  Yes, she cries, throws some tantrums, yet forges forward trying to understand her existence.<br /><br />I found myself smiling almost all the way through, though, in honesty, there were times of tears.  The writing is accurate to a thirteen year old girl's way of judging her surrounding in the early 2000's.  Andi volunteers at a nursing home and food bank.  Seeing the woes of the hungry and the elderly temper her from an inflated spirit due to wealth and position.  The reader struggles with her in her efforts, rooting for Andi to do the right thing in situations where some other teens wouldn't.<br /><br />Many of the characters come and go, but I felt attached to most of them.  Only a deft writer can achieve that symmetry of meeting people and then letting them go.<br /><br />A story I guarantee will leave you uplifted and hopeful as well as throughly amused.  For once a teenager isn't ready to blow up her school or annihilate her family.

1853675881;4;1853675881;5.0;This is a reprint of the first of Charles Oman's masterful seven volume History of the Peninsular War, and covers the period from the initiation of hostilities to Moore's retreat to Corunna.  Quite simple, this is the definitive English language reference on the Peninsular War, and nobody can call themselves a serious student of this era without having read this series.  This first volume was published in 1902, the seventh in 1935, and although there has been mountains written since about the campaigns, the battles, and the soldiers in English, French, and Spanish, this is still the undisputed masterwork, and the standard by which all others are compared.<br /><br />Virtually all of the political, military, and economic issues related to the campaigns are presented in these volumes.  Every major battle is described in minute detail by Oman.  He personally travelled to virtually every battlefield in Spain and Portugal to better understand the lay of the land for himself.  Even more than in central Europe, the terrain played a critical role in the Peninsula, and Oman made every effort to understand how it affected the outcome.  There are detailed orders of battle for all combatants and maps for all battles.  The maps are large, color foldout format for the more significant battles.  Political events are also described, particularly as they relate to the military sphere.<br /><br />There are some drawbacks/limitations to all the books in this series.  First, there is a HEAVY pro-British bias in outlook in all these books.  I got the impression that Oman considered the French to be largely incompetent.  These books to not present a balanced view, or even seriously try to explain the French perspective of the campaigns.  The Spanish are also presented as largely irrelevant, although most of the fighting was in Spain!  Second, there are few details of the guerilla operations.  This may be the first war in which guerilla operations (what we would today call fourth generation war) played an important (decisive?) role.  Oman doesn't omit discussion of these entirely, but they are certainly downplayed.  I think that a more detailed discussion of guerilla leaders, operations, and their relationship with the larger military campaigns would have been a great addition to an already long series.  Third, like virtually all English military historians, this is a virtual hagiography of Wellington.  Don't let this in anyway prevent you from buying these.  This series is certainly not the end all on the subject, but it is still, after 70+ years, the best that has ever been written about it.<br /><br />The original typeface (from the early 20th century editions) has been preserved in this modern re-publication.  This really give the text an authentic feel.  Seven volumes of 600+ pages each may seem like a lot of reading, but Oman wrote with a easily readable and absorbing prose.  This series is obviously a bit of a time commitment, but I would recommend this to even someone with a passing interest in the epoch.  I should mention that I first read this serious about 15 years ago, I decided that I didn't know enough about the Peninsular War and borrowed each volume from the library.  I've since bought the reprinted volumes (a complete collection of the original volumes is a wee-bit expensive, if you can find them), and re-read sections regularly.  If you can believe it, I felt that even after seven volumes, there were many topics that Oman didn't cover in enough detail (see above)!<br /><br />In short, if you are a serious student of the Napoleonic Wars, you must read this series of books.  You will not regret the money or the time spent.  I would give this series 6 stars if I could.

1603090002;51;1603090002;4.0;"Well, well, here we go again.  After ""The Black Dossier"", which I found tremendously disappointing after so long a wait (v2 itself having been a bit of a let-down from the preceding one), Moore and O'Neill's famous Victorian adventure heroes return for an adventure with an actual plot.  The first of three 'graphic novellas' (it's basically just a slim graphic novel) telling the story of an overarching plot in the 20th century, the events of this one were alluded to in the ""Dossier"".  Plot details are discussed herein, so be warned.<br /><br />Moore said he wanted this to function both as part one of three and as a story in its own right, hence the decision to abandon the more traditional 22-page single-issue format of previous installments in favour of larger bundles.  In that sense, he has succeeded.  ""1910"" has both an internal narrative arc and an ending that augurs future plot developments.  On the question of how compelling this story is by itself, I would say reasonably so, moreso than either ""The Black Dossier"" or ""League v.2"", though many of my problems with this property remain.<br /><br />As alluded to in ""The Black Dossier"", this story picks up in 1910, with the League consisting of old standbys Mina Murray (not yet a blonde), Allan Quatermain (""Junior""), Thomas Carnacki (from W. H. Hodgson's ""The Casebook of Carnacki the Ghost Finder"", originally serialized in ""The Strand""), A. J. Raffles (another magazine serial character, created by Arthur Conan Doyle's brother-in-law, E. W. Hornung), and a male Orlando (Virginia Woolf's novel of the same name; a major figure in ""The Black Dossier"").  The reign of Edward VII has ended, and the inauguration of George V is impending, with the Great War that will bring to a definitive end this period in world history whispering on the horizon.  Our crew is following Carnacki's premonitory dreams which involve the moon-child cult of Oliver Haddo (Aleister Crowley's ""Moonchild"") and the return to town of Jack MacHeath.  Meanwhile, in a separate plot, Janni, the daughter of Captain Nemo, arrives in London hoping to escape her father's wish for her to succeed him.<br /><br />Sexual perversion and violence against women has been a recurring theme in Moore's work (in his early classic, ""Watchmen""), and repeatedly throughout the ""League"" books Moore seems to be depicting the nature of Victorian society (he did something similar in ""From Hell"", which also featured Jack the Ripper, though in a very different light to how he's shown here).  Moore has taken some criticism for his use of rape as a plot device in the past, so those critics will find more to criticize here, as the poor Janni, violated by some wharfside scum, summons her father's men to wreak deadly vengeance on the waterfront before assuming her father's identity as Nemo.  It's certainly not an act portrayed lightly, of course (and never was in his work), but as a plot element it can perhaps get a bit tiresome.  Moore has already done many stories about how, as he ends here, human civilization runs on ""monstrous deeds"".<br /><br />From a narrative perspective, this story repeats some of the problems I had with earlier iterations of this group:  the main characters don't do or accomplish much in the course of the story, there's little character development (only, really, in Janni's case, and that's a fairly standard story that Moore doesn't add anything new to here), or any of the things that make Moore's best work special.  The most notable feature is probably Moore's extensive use of written music, as both MacHeath and a seaside madame named Suki spend more or less all their screentime 'singing' (which comes across to the reader as rhymed narration or monologues).  This is a unique use of the comic book format that I'm not sure would really work in a visual medium, given the time that passes between panels of the song.  As with Moore's ""From Hell"", there's a great deal of criticism of Britain's class structure here, and the hypocrisy of the upper class of this era.  Kevin O'Neill's art is customarily good.<br /><br />This is probably the best whole installment of the ""League"" franchise since the original volume in 1999.  All the same, I cannot escape the feeling that there are more interesting things Moore could be doing with his time.";1242250622000;Moore goes Edwardian.;AEI7CRLJBRIL5XIRNVRH6QMUMBIA;False

I like more heart and whimsy and humor in my chick lit and I'm afraid this novel fails in all three aspects. In fact, the only humor I can recall is the passage where Lucy and Daniel go to the Indian restaurant and re-work song lyrics to fit the Indian dishes they were having.<br /><br />The heroine was not lovable (too depressed and way, way too much self-hatred). Lucy acknowledges she has low self-esteem and boy did that ever manifest itself! I just don't enjoy the MC in a chick lit who allows herself to be a doormat.<br /><br />The hero had no balls. I felt he should have “manned up” and told her how he felt about her. Instead, he dated Lucy's roommate (Karen) when he knew at the time he already had feelings for Lucy. Also, from Lucy's narration, whenever Daniel was around, Karen always flirted Daniel, giving strong hints she'd like something romantic to develop with him. Thus, unless he was a complete moron, how could Daniel fail to notice that? I don't think I could forgive a guy who “used” a friend for  - what, exactly?  Sex? Companionship? And not only that, the relationship lasted months! Again, he knew going into it that he was not prepared for a long-lasting (i.e. marriage) relationship with Karen, so why string it out? Thus, I felt it was selfish of him to start anything with Karen in the first place. Surely, if Daniel's that much of a man-whore he could have had anyone else besides Lucy's friend!<br /><br />But, at least Daniel does redeem himself to be worthy of a HEA denouement. Lucy? She never deserved her happy ending. The only thing she learned in life was at long last how to recognize alcoholism and alcoholics – and even that took forever. Her willful blindness of her father's drinking problem just made her look like an idiot. Funny how her two brothers were clear-eyed about the truth of their family except Lucy. Truly, it's admirable she tried to be there for her father, but my overriding feelings about her co-dependency were contempt, mockery and repugnance. Maybe that says something about me, rather than Lucy but that's just how I feel.<br /><br />If the glowing reviews from Booklist, The Chicago Tribune and The Independent were specifically about “Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married”, someone ought to sue for false advertising. IMO, this novel was a huge fail in the ChickLit genre.;1441347809000;ChickLit fail;AF5NVM6IJCCOOVETAN37BEJ2A5MA;False

They're bad. Really, very bad. And, while I could pick apart this entry in the series, I think it's time to step away from heavy criticism for a moment and concentrate on the good. Now is the perfect time to do it because Assassins is far and away the best in the series thus far.<br /><br />I don't know what happened to make it so, but the fact remains. Assassins approaches decent writing.<br /><br />By allowing even the slightest bit of ""gray"" into the character of Rayford, there develops interesting conflict between him and the other members of the Tribulation Force. I loved his confrontation with 'T' (which was also one of the only examples of actual Christian virtue I've seen in the series, another huge plus here) and hope for a hinted-at confrontation with Buck further down the line. I've known many, many Christians in my time, and I wouldn't describe one of them as being ""perfect."" I'm sure that LaHaye & Jenkins would agree with me on that, and I'm glad to see that start to creep into their heroes.<br /><br />Also, a great thing about this entry in the series was that it didn't wait until the very ending of the novel to have something exciting happen. The pattern, till now, had been to have one Tribulation per novel, usually in the last few pages. Here, we get a Tribulation early on, and so are actually dealing with exciting events during the majority of the book, not just discussing their possibility. That's a great step forward!<br /><br />Leah Rose seems like a strong character, and might reverse the seeming trend to render all female characters irrelevant; the character of Chloe has never realized its potential, and Hattie approaches a caricature of a non-believer, but Leah might be the one to present a strong, central woman to the cast. Only time will tell there.<br /><br />These positives -- a more exciting plot and deeper characterizations -- are only a beginning. And, I fear, they might easily be reversed by the novels to come.

0745685404;1;0745685404;3.0;"The rise of Sartre as a public intellectual happened in the 1940s. He made the case for stronger links between intellectuals and the people. The context is the experience of the war.During the war we have the creation of a vacuum: we have a no. of intellectuals who are tainted because of their activities in the war; either because they’d written in support of Nazism, or because they hadn’t been explicit enough in their criticisms of Nazi Germany or Vichy. What’s distinctive about Sartre is that he was successful in a no. of different fields: journalist, philosopher,  novelist, playwright. Sartre’s philosophy, in the way he articulated it around 1945 resonated with the French public. That is distinctive. At the time a no. of collaborationist intellectuals were being prosecuted, simply for what they had written, and some of the people like Robert Brazziac received the death sentence. During those trials the responsibility of the individual, in particular the intellectual, becomes prominent. Intellectual collaboration goes alongside economic collaboration. Intellectual collaboration is more important because you influence people,who can influence other people, who influence other people. So what Sartre does, he redefines his philosophy during that period, he makes it more digestible, simple, and he centres it around the responsibility of the intellectual. This becomes a moral category. It’s a prerequisite: you need to be able to speak out, need to intervene, and that’s where the notion of the engaged intellectual comes into play. But he cynically dumps the baggage he needs to get rid of, the German philosophers. Being and Nothingness of 1943 is an engagement with German philosophy. Heidegger was implicated in the Nazi regime. The famous lecture he gives, Socialism and Humanism(1945),he explains his philosophy in simple terms, while making minimum  references to German philosophy. He presents a philosophy in tune with the times. He depicts the experience of the war in line with the way De Gaulle was presenting the war, which is very much a resistant socialist. The idea that Vichy was very much an act of collaboration of a small elite. That most French people, either or in practice, were at least in spirit, resistance fighters. During this period he writes a very important essay&#34;What is a collaborator?&#34; Collaboration and anti-Semitism is a product of people on the margins of French society, people not properly integrated, hankering for an external force, e.g. Nazi Germany, because they’re not really part of French society. He provides a vocabulary that makes sense of the trauma of the war in a way that is remarkably healing. He’s part of a broader tradition of the authoritative, public intellectual,people who have gone through all the right educational channels,  steeped in a high profile discipline like philosophy, who speak about a wide range of subjects with some authority,without necessarily having expertise as such like Sartre. By the 1950s 1960s, with the institutionalisation of the social sciences, this kind of intellectual is no longer quite acceptable.People feel you need methodology, a sense of expertise, in order to be able to speak out about a no. of social and political issues today.<br /><br />Sartre's existentialism owed a lot to the German philosophers of Hegel, Husserl and Heidegger, and it was Sartre's reaction to these that gave rise to his philosophy of existentialism as described in Being and Nothingness, which was an individualist philosophy of freedom. However as he moved into the 50s and 60s he no longer could apply this philosophy to politics, which he became articulate in, so he dropped the philosophy more and more and embraced Marxism,a more effective tool to diagnose society's ills and campaign on. He played down the German connection after the war, and tried to marry existentialism with Marxism and humanism, but it didn't work. Sartre was a bad philosopher, but was a good psychologist, pamphleteer and a radical in politics. He rose to become the leading public intellectual in France because of his leadership of the Resistance, and giving the French people anew image of themselves. To him only the marginal became collaborationists, the majority of the people in the centre were of the resistance. Camus has come out of that period with his reputation enhanced as being the anti-Marxist. He didn't tell lies to the workers to keep them happy like Sartre. This book seems like a good read. Of course Camus never claimed to be a philosopher or an existentialist. He wrote about the 'absurd'. He took the moral high ground of thought due to the truth to his origins: an Algerian Frenchman born outside of France, representing its best values. He was condemned by Sartre and Les Tempes Modernes for disliking the consequences of revolution, violence, bloodshed.<br /><br />By 1945 Sartre felt the need to engage with the present, when philosophical considerations become secondary to his intellectual/political being. Then Sartre reinvents himself as a political activist. He associates with a no. of political events, tries to organise his own left wing party, becomes involved in the decolonisation movement, Algeria, Vietnam, the student movement, Maoism and so on. Philosophy is becoming less important to him: he makes an attempt to link his philosophy to Marxism. He gets involved in all these events, but his philosophy is not particularly useful  for tackling these social/political issues like decolonisation. Marxism is more appropriate to analysing events than the individualistic tendencies of his existentialism. With the rise of the social sciences, structuralism becomes more important: its more compatible with other analyses like psychoanalysis, Marxism, social sciences; and so existentialism is on its own in a world in which the social sciences are much more prominent. Sartre is now a footnote in 20th century philosophy, but he became important in the mid-twentieth century of France as  a public figure who utilised rhetoric to communicate. Meurleau-Ponty, though academic, will survive as a philosopher of importance.";1453057839000;""" You do not arrest Voltaire"" ( De Gaulle)";AHF6U626DEL5MFQGOO5GJHZ6B3QQ;False

I have not been reading as much as I used to lately (I have the pregnancy nesting phase to thank for that) and for me to choose reading over cleaning right now is a big deal.

We had the privileged girl (whose POV was annoyingly told in 2nd person and I still can't figure out why), the scrappy poor girl given the chance of a lifetime, and the brave boy fighting for something larger than himself.<br /><br />And, after 50% of the book just setting up the races and the characters' motives, they don't even interact with each other. When they finally converge, they stay in their own narratives, unaffected by the others'; no banter, no personal challenges, no understanding of the others' stories, no meaningful interaction.<br /><br />The race itself felt glossed over, with most attention given to riders fighting with each other off horseback. And the phoenix horses, which are the huge draw, were like a side note, or an after-thought. They aren't given personalities and are treated like tools or vehicles.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the characters and the first half of the book did not pull me in, and although the race itself was more interesting, I think an awesome story concept was lost in all the politics.";1579626909051;More phoenix horses, please!;AFTG3XGB2G7L7ISKRMUGTFGGOV7Q;False

He tracks the thief to Hawaii, but complications arise and what started as a simple payback mission, turns upside down.<br /><br />This reads more like a suspenseful soap opera with various characters throughout. I think the author does a good job of mixing enough back story into what is a shorter novel than most.<br /><br />Characters<br /><br />Richard 'Rico' Sanders: over 6', dark eyes, works for a gangster, curly black hair, 4 siblings, parents dead<br /><br />Jerry: smokes, works with Rico, pale, sandy brown hair, 3 older brothers<br /><br />Jean: prostitute, red hair, dad dead, divorced, 3 sisters<br /><br />Robert McDuffie: owns several stores, married<br /><br />Evelyn McDuffie: Robert's wife, black svelte<br /><br />Frank Litvak: gangster, overweight, late 40s, balding<br /><br />Paul Elliott: attorney, widower<br /><br />One of the problems I had with characters is I think some of them were black but that didn't come across. No, they don't have to have stereotypical characteristics, but when I made a mental picture, I pictured several of these characters as Caucasian. A character who had a definite influence on the story was introduced too late in the story and I felt that part was forced. As if the author thought: Wait, I have to throw in one more piece of plot. I think this character should have been brought in earlier, especially since the reason for his later inclusion was shown near the beginning.<br /><br />Dialogue<br /><br />Pretty good. Some voices tried to come through. Many books have average conversations and voices and I think this one fits in with those.<br /><br />Writing<br /><br />Profanity. Book separated into Parts.<br /><br />For the most part I think this was solid writing. As mentioned above it had more of a soap opera feel to it especially since there was omnipresent POV. Rico was the only character I felt close to. Jean a little bit, but not much.<br /><br />One thing that stood out that struck me odd was (no spoiler, just more details of the plot): Litvak gives Rico a valuable necklace. Robert steals the necklace. Hence the chase. However, I didn't ever figure out the reason gave Rico the necklace in the first place. Litvak had had it stolen and I assume was going to have Rico give it to a fence, but this wasn't clear. And for Rico to be so nonchalant about handling and carrying the very expensive piece of jewelry wasn't quite believable.<br /><br />My Rank:<br /><br />Green Belt;1465810250000;This reads more like a suspenseful soap opera with various characters throughout;AFDKMPLZX7ACJBYSEMZXLRTRGBVQ;False

He had a great approach by placing thought-provoking exercises periodically to stimulate the reader to really stop, think, and apply.  The personal story he related regarding his own battle against high debt was moving and compelling.  The length (300 pages) was excessive and caused by endless rambling once a point was made.  If the ""meat"" of this book were condensed into about 150 pages, without all the fluff, it would be a great improvement.  It also would have been much more powerful if he could have named some of those ""Top 1%"" for whom the inspiration is based.

0140177620;8;0140177620;5.0;Having just finished reading The Meaning of Night - A Confession, I kept trying to remember what this book reminded me of.  Then it dawned on me, I had read Charles Palliser's Quincunx a number of years ago but had failed to review it.  Maybe that's because it's such a prodigious piece of literature, that it stops one cold as to where to begin a review.<br /><br />After several years and numerous other books, many of the finer points and details of Quincunx have escaped me, yet the feeling of the book, the sense of realism and authenticity have been reawakened by Cox's novel, The Meaning Of Night.  Few books have remained with me as has The Quincunx and it was wonderful to be reminded of it again by Cox's latest work. Quincunx is a spellbinding story of murder, deceit, love, and revenge in Victorian England.<br /><br />There are many who won't like Quincunx because it takes a lot out of the reader, one must pay attention and carefully because there are twists, turns, characters, and incidences that you must keep straight in order to fully appreciate the mastermind behind the novel. But, so amazing to me, is the fact that Palliser never loses the thread and even if at times, I felt a bit hoodwinked, the author does an extraordinary job of tying all of the loose ends together by the end of the book.<br /><br />In fact, just reminiscing about this novel makes me want to go and read it again.  I'm certain it will not disappoint.  One can go again and again to this wellspring of work and never come away unfed.<br /><br />It is a bibliophilic, murderous confection straight out of Dicken's period of foggy and dirty old England.  It is remarkably entertaining and the ending will not disappoint.<br /><br />If you enjoy English murder and mayhem, you'll like this book.  I'm sorry it took me so long to come back and review it.  It's not that there aren't enough reviews of the book, its just that when you're emotionally moved by a novel, you should not let it get away without decrying its amazing ability to entertain.<br /><br />This book contains a deft plot, many subplots, clever mysteries, and meaty characters and an evocative ending. Though not an easy read, it is truly a wonderful adventure though it traipses through some extraordinarily dark escapades.

B01LL8BSNM;1;B01LL8BSNM;4.0;International court and a mass genocide set the stage for this tense legal thriller. 400 Roma refugees disappear in the area of Barupra, Bosnia that was under US control in 2004. Now over a decade later a witness is stepping forward with claims of mass genocide. Ferko Ricnic -- the remaining sole survivor -- attests that masked soldiers gathered all of the gypsy residents into a cave before setting off an avalanche via grenade, burying the people alive. The International Criminal Court at the Hague, in charge of prosecuting mass atrocities, wants an American lawyer to prosecute in which Bill ten Boom seems the perfect fit. Early fifties, newly divorced and recently retired from his law career -- Boom sees this case as an opportunity of a lifetime. Boom's tasked with investigating Ferko's claims across different continents but the only thing certain is nothing is quite as it seems.

There are so many emotions running through me as I write this review. We learn a lot through this novella. First off, Violet... I have no words for her. We find out why she cheated on her husband. In my honest opinion, the only one to blame for her life is herself. She made the life she &#34;wanted&#34; and should deal with each and every aspect of it and not blame it on Rose, because she felt the need to protect her. Joe.. my heart breaks for him for more than just the fact that he is expecting a baby with Hilary. We find out another reason why Mason doesn't like Joe. I love that in the end Mason and Joe will be working together. I love both Mason and Joe and I find myself constantly tossing over who I want Rose with more. They would both be great for her as they both love her more than they love themselves and would do absolutely anything for her. Rose is one lucky girl.<br /><br />This is a quick read but definitely worth every page. The extra information that Swank shares with us through this novella help develop the series even more. You get a better understand of why the characters make the decisions that they do and why they are where they are in life.";1522962999639;Excellent addition to the series;AHQDZKUSITWMLZQANLYZULRVV46A;True

At least six television programs (three ""CSI's,""two ""NCIS's"" and ""Body of Proof"") all stress how medical procedures are used to determine the guilt or innocence of alleged criminals. Unfortunately the limitations of these studies are rarely identified. Dr. Gavin Hamilton's book, ""The Nurses are Innocent, The Digoxin Poisoning Fallacy,"" addresses this issue in great detail. He identifies the medical problems that resulted in the indictment of a nurse at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada for the deaths of children alleged due to her administration of the cardiac drug Digoxin. His clinical observations on the contaminants present within intravenous solutions, as well as the misuse of postmortem blood digoxin levels provide the fascinating scenario which eventually resulted in the nurse's proof of innocence.

When her dead husband's ashes show up on her front door step, she's not sure what to do with them or her life. As she tries to make decisions about the ashes as well as her life, secrets come to the surface that she would never expect. Did she know her husband as well as she thought she did? Will she be able to move on with her life with the ashes or will it bring everything to a screeching halt?<br /><br />Thank you to NetGalley and Harlequin for the opportunity to read and review this book.<br /><br />When I first started reading this book, I had though I knew where this story was going to go, but there were twists and turns all along the way that I wasn't expecting. Charlotte has been a widow for much longer than she was married to Decker. For the past five years, she's been living her life trying to best not to let her past intersect with her present. But when her husband's ashes show up after the mausoleum he was buried in burns down, her whole world gets turned upside down.<br /><br />This was the first book I have read by Emily Belden, but I look forward to reading more of what she writes. I know she has one other book called Hot Mess and I have added it to my TBR.<br /><br />If you like romance books with a little bit of suspense behind them, you will enjoy this book. The title can have many different meanings in this book which I discovered after I finished reading it. At first I thought it might be the name of the dating app Charlotte was developing, then her husband's ashes show up so it could be that too.<br /><br />Overall this book was very enjoyable and highly recommended.;1579199176057;Not What I was expecting;AHH5U765IM2TG27WGCXO7GA5IMMQ;False

052542881X;0;052542881X;5.0;I was more than a bit disappointed in the content of this book. The author did not take a linear approach to the biography he jumped around from year to year from paragraph to paragraph. In a manner of speaking it was rather confusing to try to figure out what time in Elizabeth Bishops life he was talking about. The author also spent a great deal of time interpreting Bishops poems rather than giving what was happening in her life at the time of writing. And in some parts the author actually appears rather judgmental of Bishop's life. So, if you are looking for a biographical book on Elizabeth Bishop I suggest you. This book is rather confusing, and the author spends a great deal of time interpreting Bishop's poems and not even doing a good job of it.

Edward paints a picture of a government slowly after 9/11 expanding their power for ""the greater good"".  He also shows his mental state not just on 9/11 but before, during, and after.  I can't help but compare our childhoods as they were very similar.<br /><br />9/11 turned this man into what most would consider a patriot.  He wanted to serve his country and help out the best he could.  He wasn't going after money as he was taking positions paying less but doing more.  After he realized the scope of the governments mass surveillance program that's when he truly became a patriot.  This man sacrificed  his freedom, family, and the women he loved not just to tell the American people but the world what truly was being done.  When I think if I would have done the same thing in his situation give up my wife, well paying job (he was making six figures by that time), friends, everything I knew just to tell people I do not know what the government is doing I cowardly have to admit I would not.  He has a level of courage I wish I possessed.<br /><br />This book also scared me with everything the government was doing and probably still is doing.  XKEYSCORE sounds like a nightmare but real.  That is just one of the many systems he describes in detail.  This is in no way boring, Snowden has a great way of describing things in laymen's terms for the non technical people.  He also has a great sense of humor and made me chuckle throughout the book.<br /><br />I am happy Mr. Snowden is free (as free as you can be exiled in another country) and with the love of his life.  I hope he will be pardoned and allowed to come home one day.  I fear he will most likely be extradited and punished though.

His favorite part of theatre is improv class, but he needs work on his give and take skills.<br /><br />As I read the book, I realized that this book spells out a lot of the skills needed to improve social skills for people on the AUTISM spectrum.  The listening skills, give-and-take, and team playing required in improv would work well with teaching social skills to those who don't have these abilities -- and the beauty is that when one is successful, you get immediate positive feedback (laughter) which motivates you to try harder.<br /><br />I really think that improv classes could go a long way to teach older higher-functioning children on the autism spectrum how to be funny -- thereby helping them with social skills.<br /><br />Parents of children on the autism spectrum -- really consider purchasing this book, and possibly setting up improv classes, in order to help your teenage child understand humor.  It could go a long way to helping them adapt to their high school experience, and help their peers see them favorably so that they can improve their friendships.;1245381021000;Excellent book for improv and for social skills training for those on the autistic spectrum;AHMBSRDCXNAUPHSIJNTZCAW3BTAA;True

I seriously find this amazing! I appreciate when the mold is broken and done well. I also loved the last 1/3 of the book! I can't really talk much about it because I don't want to give anything away (though I think I am one of the last people on the planet to read the book). Let's just say that the action/suspense/intrigue were finally starting to fall into place. I started caring about the characters and what happened to them.<br /><br />What I Liked: I thought the factions were a really interesting idea. I mean there has to be ""fall-out"" when you place one attribute above all others---you become corruptible. I thought that it was interesting look at how something that shouldn't be cause for alarm can be the center of it.<br /><br />What made me go Huh?: It took awhile for me to buy into this world. While on the surface the idea of how the factions are divided up is intriguing--I just didn't get to see enough of each faction to buy it. How does being on of the 5: Candor (the honest), Abnegation (the selfless), Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful), or Erudite (the intelligent)) lead to wide spread corruption. I just needed to see more of the faction interaction to buy into the world. I never quite got (till the end) why being Divergent was bad. Even in the end, it explained now why Divergent was bad but in the beginning why was it? If you chose a faction and live by the rules, I just didn't see it being different that being a transfer. Maybe I am over-thinking it.<br /><br />Final Thought: I did enjoy the book despite my problems with not connecting to the world.";1331321503000;Things are just starting to get interesting....where is the next book!;AEU5PWQ52VQLMMZCUWJV7KO4UQLQ;True

0671869205;1;0671869205;5.0;David McCullough has written a brilliant and thoroughly researched portrait of a common man, who proved to be anything but common. McCullough captures the true essence of Harry S. Truman in this moving rendition of the man's life.<br /><br />Truman was at the center of some of the most important issues of the twentieth century, including the decision to drop two atomic bombs to end the war with Japan, the Marshall Plan, the Fair Deal, civil rights, medicare, Korea (yes this turned out to be very important at the time, even though many thought it was a mistake), the Berlin airlift, the recognition of Israel, the United Nations, NATO, and so much more. No wonder the man as president has been recognized as one of the great presidents of all time. He did so much in his nearly eight years in office.<br /><br />Truman was truly a man of character, and before I read this book, I really didn't know much about him or his background. I only knew he had made the decision to drop the atom bomb on Japan and that he began the Korean war in which my father fought. I had no idea what kind of man he was: principled, kind, defiant, forthright, headstrong and loyal to a fault. He was also a decisive leader at a time when a decisive leader was desperately needed. And what was so striking to me, is how the the presidency never changed the man from his modest beginnings. Truman was one of a kind. A great American story of hard work and perseverance.<br /><br />I have to mention here that I read some of the one or two star comments, which thankfully they're not much of, but I had to laugh when someone had the ignorant audacity to state that McCullough's portrait of Truman was too one-sided, too subjective and there was not enough objectivity. Either that person doesn't have very good reading comprehension skills or never read the book, because I thought McCullough's rendering of Truman was very far reaching, very objective and showed the man's greatness and his flaws, through the eyes of his good friends and his enemies.<br /><br />In sum, I really loved this biography and the thousand pages went by very quickly for me.  One other note: it was finally great to read a Pulitzer Prize winning book that actually deserved the award.  Kudos David McCullough. You have written one heck of a book!;1334701819000;A brilliant portrait of a great man.;AEV77KHAU6FSXJ6OXGQNGVOUCJNQ;False

B00R6CWC6K;0;B00R6CWC6K;5.0;"This is a great side story to the Unbounded series. It paints a completely different picture of Ava, making her more ""human"" and approachable. I liked this Ava very much. However, I would have liked a little more explanation about Smith, although what was provided could be pieced together loosely. I have to ask if Erin got her Unbounded genes from Ava, or others, twice. Otherwise, why was Ava corresponding with Miles? It was a little confusing and glossed over so quickly. Maybe I misunderstood something. I will have no problem rereading this novella to try to figure it all out, if I can. My one real gripe is that there is little information about when in the series to read this. I would have been less unhappy about the second book if I had known that this book filled in a bit of the time between the two. There should be something in the blurb that explains the best place in the series to read this book. I also would have thought differently about Ava in the later books if I had read this earlier on. Because of that, and the confusion about Miles, in particular, I would rate this at slightly under 5 stars - not a full 5 stars. I still recommend the book.

1621050041;0;1621050041;4.0;The narrator takes center stage here, cleverly interjecting random notes here and there, but this is more precisely the author, Vince Kramer himself, whose attitude and disposition toward fiction writing, on a literal level, that is, making stuff up about stuff, quickly reveals itself as silly, juvenile, absurd, and vulgar. And that is the payoff--the manner of storytelling, let alone the content, that is a stream-of-consciousness window into Vince Kramer making s*** up as he goes along. Ordinarily, this would be a terrific turn off, like listening to some little kid make 'splosion sounds with his mouth as it becomes painfully clear just how much video games have wrecked his imagination, but like a good William Gass short story, we are in it for the ride. The pacing takes on a cinematic feel, such as when Suzanne has a Mexican Death Worm chased out of her with tequila, and, of course, the rest of the cast is drinking Margaritas because they like to party all the time.<br /><br />Around the halfway point, Kramer begins telling a story, sort of like how an action science fiction movie will grudgingly slow down for a moment in order to justify all the 'splosions thus far (the most egregious example that comes to mind is John Carter) and this is where the book loses its momentum, but it gains it back pretty fast when said death worm arrives.;1383932535000;Smart, Satirical Immaturity Run Amok;AGHOXGS2J747LMUTN5Q5VC5XXRGA;True

0553385763;30;0553385763;5.0;Palimpsest by Catherynne M. Valente tells the story of four lost and lonely travelers as they journey to a strange and beautiful city, a city that exists beyond the veil of dreams. Imagine a place of surreal delights, of bizarre masquerade balls and holy churches in which odd creatures worship in utter silence. This is Palimpsest, a city that is neither dream nor reality for those who stumble into its borders. Of course, to visit isn't enough, never enough. Visitors long for residency, they desire to make Palimpsest their reality. Such desires, however, come at a cost.<br /><br />For reasons we don't early know, people exist in our world who bear marks on their skin, black tattoos that appear to be pieces of an otherworldly map. These people are gateways to Palimpsest, to enter involves sex and the heavy sleep after orgasm. Those who sleep after climax in our world wake to wander the streets of Palimpsest, the part of the map on their partner's body, except in the case of first time visitors. First timers are required to visit a certain fortune-teller, a woman with the head of a frog. She sees clients only in groups of four, these four are then bound together, a family of sorts. Whenever in Palimpsest, no matter how far apart, these four strangers intimately share each other's experiences. They taste the same tastes, they feel each other's pleasure and pain. When morning comes to Palimpsest, visitors then wake in our world. New-comers also wake with a mark of their own, a new gateway to this gorgeous and sometimes cruel city. Permanent residence is elusive, but not impossible. The novel follows four characters who have lost something in our world and desperately hope to find it in Palimpsest.<br /><br />Valente has created something absolutely brilliant in Palimpsest. Her decadent use of language brings so much life into a world that few have the skill to even imagine, let alone write into existence. To me, Palimpsest is an intricate metaphor for the nature of sex and relationships. Unlike any liquor, any drug, sex can take a person completely outside of their reality. In one sense, sex can be a hollow, empty act, a temporary escape from one's broken life. Yet, in another sense, sex with the right person can be a perfect sacrament. Two people inside one another creating a world of their own. Sex doesn't have to be about running away from something awful, it can be about moving toward something amazing. Sex with the right person can feel like going home after being caught in a terrible storm. Palimpsest explores these ideas with lush prose and haunting imagery. Cat Valente is definitely a singular talent at the top of her game.;1238418585000;Brilliant;AHHL3FA3ZUDBGPPT6W6XHDEVBEJA;True

B072BLVM83;3;B072BLVM83;4.0;“In families like mine there is no crime worse than telling the truth.” —Tara Westover<br /><br />What does it mean to be educated? This book will make you think about what it really means to have an education—to be free to form your own opinions—and if the risks and sacrifices one might have to make in pursuit of knowledge, are worth it in the end. It’s message will both inspire and disturb you, and haunt you in your dreams.<br /><br />Educated is the true story about the author, Tara Westover, growing up in an isolated, dysfunctional, survivalist family with radical views, who, in contrast, live on a beautiful mountain in Idaho. As the youngest child in a family of seven—5 boys and 2 girls—Tara’s story is both heartbreaking and inspirational. Due to their father’s extreme political, religious, and moral beliefs, Tara and her siblings were not given access to medical attention or public education, nor did her parents believe in anything government related, believing it to be a system of brainwashing.<br /><br />The book is fairly well written and deeply poignant. It is definitely hard to put down, but it is also extremely disturbing on so many levels. There are plot holes and some timeline inconsistencies, and some horrific parts that are so emotional that they are difficult to imagine, let alone read. Tara’s experiences with her older brother, Shawn—whom she understandably both loved and hated—were not only shocking, they were heartbreaking. Equally appalling is the fact that ultimately most of the family chose to ignore or hide Shawn’s violent, unstable, abusive behavior and death threats, also choosing not to confront their father about it, even though both parents, admittedly the mother, knew what had been going on. They choose to protect it with a blind eye, possibly out of some kind of misguided family loyalty, shame, and more than likely, fear. But like Tara’s brother, Tyler, wrote in a letter to her: “This is a perverted idea of family loyalty. They claim faith, but this is not what the gospel teaches.” Once committed, Tyler never wavered in telling their truth, though it changed his relationship with his father. However, the only true hero of the story is Tara herself.<br /><br />Personally, I feel badly for Tara’s mother who appears to have been trapped and manipulated by her choices in a clouded vision of love, trying to keep peace. I also feel badly for Tara’s father, who was obviously in need of psychological and medical intervention. And I feel badly for each of Tara’s siblings and feel they probably coped in different ways with the only life and family they had known.<br /><br />None of us can really judge Tara or understand her family without having walked in their shoes. However, it is a sad fact that abusers and their enablers distort reality for their victims in order to cover up their crimes, so what Tara was able to accomplish—coming from her unhealthy broken environment—is truly remarkable!! Whether or not we become like our parents, is a choice we can all make. We can love and forgive those who have harmed us, without following in their footsteps. May this book help others in the same situation, to recognize psychological and physical abuse wrapped up in the arms of love, and find their own healing voice to break free!<br /><br />“You are not fool’s gold, shining only under a particular light. Whomever you become, whatever you make yourself into, that is who you always were. It was always in you. … You are gold.” —Tara Westover, Educated: A Memoir<br /><br />NOTE: It should be noted that the so called “Mormon” doctrine Tara was exposed to in her home, is not reflective in any way to the Christ-like loving teachings of the restored Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Tara’s view of religion was experienced through the eyes of her manipulative, controlling father, who was suffering from a bipolar type mental illness, although she didn’t know it at the time. Her father’s skewed view of religion unknowingly created numerous misconceptions in the home in which Tara was raised. All good things, when taken to an extreme, then mixed with the paranoia and darkness of mental illness, can turn good into evil.;1550110842592;"INSPIRATIONAL, HEARTBREAKING; EMOTIONALLY DISTURBINGLY";AGOGCKY2N4MLGNPTUAV3G45OZLRQ;True

0060182989;21;0060182989;1.0;"It grieves me to write a one-star review for Barker's new one, but his novels have been such hit-and-miss affairs for over a decade now, and THIS one was simply unreadable. It's the first time I've literally thrown a book at the wall (being halfway through the story) in disgust in ages.<br /><br />As usual, Barker takes an absolutely tantalizing concept, starts pretty decently, and then completely loses all focus, cohesion, and discipline.<br /><br />Yes, I've been reading his work since 'Books of Blood' so I know the guy's ""quirks."" The problem is that ""The Quirk Won't Work if the Work You Shirk.""<br /><br />Barker's wonderful creative foundation becomes disjointed and incoherent yet AGAIN. There's no stars to be had for simply throwing random bursts of ""disconnected imagination"" at the empty page and hoping the stray bits will all somehow amount to a story.<br /><br />The tantalizing concept in 'Mister B. Gone' is similar to Barker's pet theme of worlds or 'beings' existing and/or trapped ""within worlds."" The premise is great here: a demon trapped in the pages of an actual book, a memoir. That demon speaks directly to the reader with words of admonition and warning--words that are intended to evoke horror in the reader (or at least give us $22.95 worth of unsettling feelings).<br /><br />No such luck. The premise is the only good thing about this short novel. From Barker's half-baked description of Hell and its denizens, to the lazy writing and patchwork plotting, this is a big disappointment. Again, Barker seems to have been phoning-in his novels for awhile, and this one must have required a VERY long-distance call indeed.<br /><br />A big problem rests (gee) with the main character, the demon ""Jakobok Botch"" (Yes, demons have silly first-names and idiotic surnames in Hell and live in houses w/ plugged-up toilets and lots of pointless things happen ""below."" And there's piles of garbage down in hell, too. Yeah, that's right). Jakobok Botch whines and whimpers with no voice of mystery, intrigue, or remarkability, much less terror. The rest of the ""characters"" only get worse because they are strangled by a plot-line that doesn't meander so much as it seems to step idly into one bland, literary gopher-hole after another. The ""Quitoon"" character is pointless. Boring. Aimless. Irrelevant.<br /><br />  If Barker were being extra-experimental or just ""extra-quirky,"" certain things could be forgiven (or understood), but even in fantasy/horror, one can't spit-shine pure drivel, no matter how hard one tries. And Barker didn't appear to try very hard, here. And this IS drivel. The dust-jacket copy touting Barker's exploration of the ""very nature of good and evil"" in this book has got to be the saddest overstatement I've seen in a long time. The book explores nothing remotely substantial along these lines, reaches no interesting conclusion, and is no more penetrating than something written by L. Ron Hubbard about the origins of...well, ANYTHING.<br /><br />  Again, Barker seems still quite able to summon fine initial concepts, but his execution has become hapless and random. His prose is still decent, but he needs to remember how to write an actual story that makes sense--even in his marvelously imaginative ""worlds."" Without question, the need for basic tight writing and narrative coherence is all the more crucial when Barker is off in some ""other"" dimension. His creations deserve better; his characters do. To say nothing of his fans.<br /><br />  I'm not best pleased to write this review, but the book was far more displeasing. Hopefully, Barker will resurrect his interest in the completion of the 'Abarat' books and their excellent, source-relevant display of fantasy-writing and imagery. Barker's heart seemed to be in the right place in those unique books.<br /><br />  It's MIA in this one.

But, it fermented like he said it would and lots of oven spring.  I will improve on my forming next loaf (tomorrow).<br />The book also gives time schedules and some options  - always a bit of a challenge to figure out how the 'routine' fits into your schedule, but he helps with that.<br />I have a bunch of bread books - but this one changes things for me.;1498448158353;Great book - great insights - nice side story.

It had its down points but its up points outnumbered them. It was a fast-paced, quick read that always kept me on the edge of my seat. At the start of the book I was intrigued by the odd premises. I felt like I was in the main character's shoes with the good descriptions, and a feeling of knowing the settings.<br /><br />""At the end the story turned out to be more of a light-hearted story than a Dracula-thriller. But the ending had its own perks compared to many other slightly-scary stories I have read. Once or twice I had trouble figuring out the order of the words. These are the only notable lackings of this book. It has a very good story contained within its pages. I had fun reading this book and I hope other people will, too.

Just rely on author reputation and star rating. Read details after finishing books.<br /><br />Now, this queen is not the character introduced and developed in the previous two books. Surrounding characters comment on the queen's motives, personality and behavior about things that are not depicted in events. They are supposedly drawing conclusions based on what they observe yet we are not given events to make the same observation. Consequently, we are fed an idea of what the queen has become. This is subpar writing. I didn't know what this character was intended to be. On one hand she seemed to be perfectly queenly in her decisions. I didn't find any to be conflicted like surrounding characters had concluded. I didn't find this queen particularly &#34;vengeful&#34; either. Another idea actively being sold to us by other character's observations. She wasn't really the character of the first two books. She was just a well-prepared queen with a good memory and education who had inherited the Realm. The events leading to this were not even crucial to the final book's story. The death of her brother was not an impetus. Overcoming her injury and captivity was not really vital to her queenly decisions. Given the title of this book and her rather generic behavior I wondered if there would be a twist but it didn't come.<br /><br />In the first book we grew along with Vaelin Al Sorna as we experienced and discovered things through Vaelin with his developing song. In the final book he is without his song and another character is tasked with being his song proxy. We have to read a description from a 2nd person perspective.  Making this worse there are several different cultures interacting who do not speak the same language. All of it has to be interpreted by different characters. This is an overburdened reliance on 2nd person description. Everything has to be spelled out because there is no other way to comprehend what is going on without Vaelin's song. Plus all of the names of people from various tribes and races were difficult to keep track of and many names were too similar to others. Even though the characters shared profound experiences the relationship between Dahrena and Vaelin felt less substantial than his relationship with the sister, Sherin, he fell for in the first book because it was all spelled out in words more than effectively depicted through clever writing.<br /><br />I felt detached from the story. I read on because I loved the first book and wanted to know how this tale ended but it was easy to put the book down and I never felt compelled to keep reading when I had other things to do. I did not feel a lot of anything reading this book. This book lacked cleverness in its explanation tying up the trilogy story arc. The first book left a lasting impression that haunted me. The second introduced a good character, Reva, and culminated in a great accomplishment. However, this book took effort to sustain an interest in seeing it through to the end. I would not even say I am disappointed.

1574557203;5;1574557203;5.0;For those who remember the Baltimore Catechism, the question and answer format provided an easy way to explore questions of Catholic Faith, Morals and Doctrine.  Although the CATECHISM OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH provides the most comprehensive exposition of matters of faith and is the standard for study and inquiry, its sheer depth and breadth often intimidated many who sought to develop a greater understanding of the faith.  Recognizing this, Pope Benedict worked with his predecessor, Pope John Paul II, to develop this compedium in which essentials are once again communicated in a well-written, thorough-yet-direct question and answer format.<br /><br />The COMPENDIUM follows the outline and meticulously references the CATECHISM.  Yet, the topics address specific questions in easy to understand language.  It is an excellent tool for RCIA and catechesis for both lifelong Catholics or those who are just entering into the faith.<br /><br />I recommend that this be added to every Catholic family's library!;1190714234000;What's Old is New Again;AHRLYCDMKTVLEYAO2JJDTDO4ET2Q;True

Now, this wouldn't have been my obvious choice for a beach read (even for me, a wanna-be academic), but it was engrossing, addictive, and titillating in all the ways a good beach read should be.<br /><br />As others have pointed out, Castle is honest and she doesn't soften the edges much on anyone (even herself or her current partner), but she is also gracious.  In her essay on Sontag, although she spends much of the time sketching a character you're not sure you'd want to meet, she ends with a sincere appreciation for Sontag's contribution to 20th century feminism.<br /><br />I have to admit, though, that I enjoyed the first re-published essays more than the longer one on the Professor.  In the shorter pieces, I was thrilled by her ability to weave separate threads into one coherent piece, showing connections where you thought there couldn't be one.  Her piece on the Professor worked with the same idea, but meandered here and there, trying to scoop up all of her early academia and sexual exploration/experience in to one cohesive narrative anchored by her experience with the Professor.  For me, this was too much; I felt bogged down with too much detail, and almost lost interest half way through this piece (although I was glad I pushed on as it found its momentum again quite soon).  I appreciated the succinctness of her other pieces, and that, I think, was lost in this piece.<br /><br />Yes, this is written by an academic, and there is no way around this.  It infiltrates every page because that is who she is, and she is writing honestly and openly.  It won't be everyone's idea of a good beach read, but, I have to say, I kind of like this kind of academic and can't wait to find more written by her.

0738730661;2;0738730661;5.0;"When I initially bought this book it was with the intention of planning a couples retreat for five days in the forest. I didn't know where to start and even though I had several books I could resort too, I really wanted it all in one reference guide. The Magickal Retreat came to the rescue!<br /><br />This book is definitely an all-in-one resource guide because there are a lot of areas where she poses things for you to think about and writing activities for you to plan out your own unique journey for special-me time. In the beginning, she helps you define your goals, reminds you that time frames are important and how to hone your retreat to be very focused. Her questions can be a conversation starter with yourself, your significant other, or even with a small group as to what you want to achieve with your retreat.<br /><br />One aspect this book provides which I really liked was the examples of a themed retreat. For example, a retreat for home arts, or green magick, or psychic arts, and even one for technological magick are just a few scenarios she gives. While I didn't follow these examples for my own creation, seeing how a person might develop their own retreat holiday definitely provided me with help in seeing how to put together my own plans. The book includes a recommended reading section, some basic sample blessings and rituals, and blank formatted pages you can copy and use as worksheets.<br /><br />Some people may not like the idea of planning ahead, but since we would be without phone, internet and would not be leaving the isolated cabin for five days, a basic framework needed to be put together. For example, we would not have access to a restaurant so I needed to plan on meals and groceries. We would be working with the elements and I knew there would be certain days best suited for that work. There would also be certain days of the week and their significance I wanted placed in our schedule.<br /><br />Because I have facilitated workshops myself, I really appreciated how Pesznecker encouraged you to lay out a schedule that could be changed or adapted as you went through the week. After all some plans don't work out - or may need to be dropped altogether. Very helpful was the section on how to record your retreat and how to adapt back into the ""real"" world when you return, something often left out.<br /><br />While I may have been able to think all this out for myself - given enough time and resources - what I really wanted was a guide to take me through all the ideas in my head. We were planning a couples retreat (not an individual one and the book can be adapted for this), but I hadn't really given a lot of thought to the days of the week correspondences, the time of the day correspondences, or even how we would start and end our week.<br /><br />This book brings you to a mindful place where you will consider all of the above and more - and start to see how each planned day (loosely - not set in stone) is almost planning a ceremony. In this case it is a ceremony to celebrate you!<br /><br />If you have never done a retreat, or would like ideas on how to better construct your next one, I highly recommend this book. While it is geared towards an individual, I was successful in using it to plan for two. It also is open-ended to faith so it adaptable to where you want to take it.<br /><br />Reviewed by Cinnabarys.com";1408988458000;Excellent for planning a focused, magickal retreat or study vacation;AGOXIV3IZSXUJKSCDQHUUTAJVPYQ;False

0786915749;0;0786915749;4.0;The good:<br />The writers have a pleasant, easy-to-read writing style. It was fairly fast paced, which I enjoy. There are a wide range of character types (good, conflicted, honorable, mysterious, hot head, etc). The story itself is pretty interesting and engaging. There are dwarves, elves, dragons- all the things one typically looks for in a fantasy story. I'm trying to avoid spoilers in this section, so I am being vague on purpose.<br /><br />The bad: Lack of suspense.<br /><br />SPOILERS (sorta): The main complaint I have with this book is how much good triumphs over evil almost unscathed. By that, I mean that I never really felt worried about the primary cast of characters. There was 1-2 moments throughout the book where I thought there might be actual suspense, but then it turned out to be for nothing. Admittedly, I might be a bit warped from the Game of Thrones novels, but I felt even compared to other fantasy novels, that this one is really on the safe side of happy-ever-after. Once I understood the style of this book and that the peril main characters were placed in was not genuine (in terms of nobody permanently dying), I felt myself lose interest some and just kinda coasted through the rest of the book.<br /><br />What I will say is that this is either a knock or a good thing depending on what you are wanting at the time. I definitely get in modes where I want the happily-ever-after story, where good triumphs over evil (after all, the world is crappy enough as is, so an escape from that through entertainment is a welcomed one). But right now, particularly being in a GoT type mode, I was looking for something a bit more realistic (in terms of multi-dimensional characters, more grey than black/white, etc). There is really only 1 character in the book that I would say is more than 1D (Raistlin) and perhaps in future books he will get expanded upon even more. Now the group as a whole was very multi-layered due to the cast of characters, but overall, each character was pretty 1D.<br /><br />I will return to this series in the future when I am in a mode to better appreciate it.;1435686747000;The good: The writers have a pleasant;AGHAKICMVAATZCH4S6WNHULFFRDA;True

0824817079;2;0824817079;5.0;We are so used to thinking of China as a single Han culture that we forget the existence of other cultures, such as the Tibetans (Xizang), Diao, Miao, and Hani -- not to mention the Islamic peoples of the far west. When I read SOUL MOUNTAIN, I received my first education in the subject.<br />Now I have received quite by chance this children's book from University of Hawaii Press. Upon looking at it, I was drawn in by the excellent illustrations and started reading. I can't speak for what a child would think (and I don't have one to act as a guinea pig), but I loved it.<br />The book consists of four folk tales, each from a minority culture. After each tale is a description of how it has given birth to a festival, and how that festival is celebrated today. In a society such as ours which has so little understanding of other cultures, this would be a particularly painless way of introducing children to a wider, more colorful, and fascinating world.

One night after she finishes feeding on her favorite Ice cream scooper she is staked by a unicorn through the heart. She wakes up, no one really believes her. She starts getting little good thoughts that isnt normal for her and one night she is kidnapped and stuck in a cage by some amateur vampire hunters. She fears she is about to die as the sun comes up and realizes she is still there in the sun like no vampire is supposed to be able to do. That is the start of her troubles and journey to turning good.<br /><br />I enjoyed Pearl from the beginning. I just love snarky, witty people, they make me happy. The book is full of humor and creativity. Everything about it was all around unique. Really who would have thought were-unicorns and Vampires would go so great together. Evan seems to be there from the beginning, he has a huge hero complex and strives to help people out which is totally the opposite of what Pearl stands for. You can tell from the start that there is some sort of connection between Evan and Pearl although they both seem to push it off as just being friendly.  Even though Pearl's family were technically the ""bad guys"" I still enjoyed all the characters and their personalities. Pearl becomes an outcast because she can go into the sun but is still expected to provide the feast for the Vampire King. Her parents seem to believe in her but are also dark and mysterious and tend to be a little more scary then the rest of her family. DRINK, SLAY, LOVE had an all around great plot that kept me interested. I didn't see the twist coming but I liked how it all played out.

But the problem with those kinds of books is that they're preaching to the (un)converted and that their polemical tone doesn't really help you understand the phenomenon of Christian fundamentalism in America. That's why I think REASONS TO BELIEVE fully deserves five stars: it's a great, in-depth, refreshingly non-partisan piece of reportage. That the author once considered himself a reborn Christian adds a fascinating and poignant personal angle to this journey across the American Christian landscape. If you want to seriously engage with Christian fundamentalists in America - whether you're a believer or not - this book is the best possible starting point.;1203440653000;Fair and balanced;AFRC4AIF4IICGWQZ6CCL4HZLCTIQ;False

Character development here is much more in depth and because of how the author begins the book, you are hooked until the very end.  Five different women all living through World War II, and just how difficult it could be for women back in that day.  Certainly not the options women have today!!

I gave John Bridge's book 5 stars because, while he doesn't have color drawings  like the Micheal Byrne book, it was written by a skilled contractor who  teaches the reader how to lay tile, step by step. As both an amateur tile  setter and an inspector who watches professionals, I know from experience  that everything he says is accurate and reasonable. From laying out the  floor and mixing mortar to doing a countertop, the reader feels like Mr.  Bridges is right by his side, guiding his/her steps. His anectdotes about  his wife are funny.

Mahogany being used by the natives to make shelving seems unrealistic as the closest source would be Mexico.  Arizona isn’t that close and I doubt the natives would have had a chance to trade for it.  It was said that the Little Dipper was part of the Orion constellation - wrong.  Mark had his hat in his hand when he sat down then helped with the logs for the fire.  Where did his hat go and why didn’t he hang it up when he came in the house?  The writing style was simplistic and the conversations lacked a maturity one would expect from people in their late 20s and mid 30s.  Oh, and the author kept saying the west coast.

0071445242;39;0071445242;4.0;"I totally disagree with the first reviewer; but rather than write a completely new review, I'm going to simply address that review point by point:<br /><br />First, about accents not being indicated, I think any serious language learner should ALWAYS buy the recordings if he wants to have any chance of understanding what he hears, and being understood when he speaks.<br /><br />The Hebrew print is about the same size as the English, but is in a finer font than is sometimes seen, without shading and serifs -- or maybe it's just time to get some reading glasses.  Americans often complain about ""typos"" in British books (like this one is). British books follow Oxford spellings, not Webster's.  In the Hebrew, the text is in ""ktiv maleh"", using yods and vavs in the regular spelling to suggest vowels, unlike in ""ktiv khaser"" where the vowel points are used instead.<br /><br />Yes, it introduces frequently used idioms early on, to give the learner a useful type of language to start with, even if the specific grammar point hasn't been dealt with yet.  Languages don't come in neat packages.<br /><br />About the ""complicated verb system"", this course teaches a good variety of useful verbs, in the present, past, future and imperative tenses.  That's a lot more USEFUL, to a speaker who hopes to communicate meaningfully in the language, than being able to take a root and ring all the changes on it, through ""pa'al, pu'al, nif'al, hitpa'el"" and so on.<br /><br />And about the lack of translation, Teach Yourself books wisely avoid translation exercises as much as possible. Many people make the mistake of thinking there should always be translation; but translation is a separate skill which is often not even helpful in language learning, since it presumes that everything has to go through English, which can cause serious problems for someone trying to keep up with a rapid speaker.<br /><br />In fact, my only complaint with this course is that it turned out to be much more basic than I needed.  I put in the last CD and listened to the final track, and found I could understand every single word of it.  Apparently I remember more of the language from the ""ulpan"" than I thought I did.";1131050764000;Not so bad at all....;AEZZX2GHL5LEQENH5CXWYUALHZIQ;False

B0007YJ3VQ;1;B0007YJ3VQ;5.0;"Cry, the Beloved Country is a rare book that presents a superbly written story that creates a sense of sacredness that is palpable.  The characters in the book demonstrate the struggle of humanity to overcome pain and suffering through forgiveness, redemption and love.  The main character Stephen Kumalo, an Anglican Parson in S. Africa, illustrates the gentleness, love and unselfishness that characterize the fruits of a life lived in God's presence.  In the sorrows that occur during the story however he experiences darkness described by Paton, ""There are times, no doubt, when God seems no more to be about the world.""  He refuses to lose faith in God or in the people around him.  The relationship that buds between him and the father of a man murdered by Kumalo's son represents the fruit of forgiveness and redemption. What comes from it is healing for a valley and a people.<br /><br />Paton paints the picture of S. Africa that included a beautiful country with beautiful people that had fallen victim to the vices of the modern world and the negative outcomes of a class/race-based society.<br /><br />This is a book that no doubt contributed to the healing and reconciliation among the people of S. Africa.<br /><br />In addition to its moral and spiritual qualities, the story is compelling and enjoyable to read.<br /><br />The plea of the book stands out as the cry for all humanity:<br />""God save Africa, the beloved country.

0471772801;15;0471772801;3.0;"This book is a refreshing counterpoint to more conventional self-help books.  The advice it gives--of worrying less, enjoying life more, and being open to new opportunities--is hard to argue with.  What annoys me about it is a weakness it shares with most other self-help books.  Where's the evidence that Shapiro's approach is better than any other?  Where's the evidence that Goal-Free Living actually works to make people happier or more effective?  I just don't see how travelling around the country interviewing people makes Shapiro an expert on improving people's lives.  He didn't do a double-blind clinical study, so what does he know?  There are plenty of people out there--from psychics to doctors to religious nuts--willing to hand out advice on how you should live your life. It's pretty difficult for the average person to sort out what's BS and what isn't.<br /><br />One of the easiest ways to sound profound is make contradictory statements and recommendations. Astrologers do this all the time; it's a major part of ""cold reading"" because people can read into it what they want to hear.  Shapiro makes this ploy too, by recommending both passion and detachment.<br /><br />All that said, the book isn't bad.  I like Shapiro's advice that when we make a decision, we have to accept that we made the best decision we could at the time given what we knew then, and that agonizing over it helps no one.  Mistakes are not the end of the world.  The world is complex and ever-changing, so we should not try to force our lives to turn out according to a plan.  I would like to see Shapiro's ideas get more development and research.  I really would like to know how they compare with other approaches.

B0087GJ2F8;6;B0087GJ2F8;4.0;"I was intrigued when I heard about Valerie's new book. For the most part, it's a good read. When you you have two authors, it can be hard to keep track of the characters and the facts, especially over a period of time.<br /><br />We have Vanessa, a thinly disguised Valerie, described as ""nicely sexy."" That's a girl moniker for another girl, and while I agree that she is, it rings just a little too complimentary as a description. Well intentioned I'm sure, but ...well, she is pretty by anyone's standards.<br /><br />Later in the book, she and Khoury (David) make love on the floor because their passion can't wait. Fine, been there, done that.  Next they wake up in bed and she doesn't even know how they got there. She rolls on top of him and apparently they make love again. Nice. A little too Barbara Cartland, but hey, these are girls writing the scenes and they tend to be a little less graphic than men when describing close encounters. But, two chapters later, Vanessa is described as looking over a sketch she made of David, supposedly during their last meeting. She was so knocked out with exhaustion and love making, she can't remember even getting hauled into bed, yet she somehow manged to make a sketch of him. How? When? And where did she learn to draw? Nothing suggested she had that talent and it's never brought up again. Very romantic I'm sure, but it doesn't fit.<br /><br />She's a runner and she smokes? Not very likely, even in oh so sophisticated Europe. Runners hardly ever smoke. It just hurts too much.<br /><br />Onward to Cypress where she is fighting with the assassin and she has a hand gun, an FN Five Seven, which has an effective range of just over 1500 yards, however hitting a target at that range would depend more luck than skill even for a very highly trained person, so the shoot out at over 700 yards is bit questionable.<br /><br />It also states that Vanessa heard the crack of the second rifle shot. The rifle had a suppressor which, while they wear out, would not probably made a ""crack"" on its second shot. The story in the same area also says she checked the cartridge when it was meant that she checked the clip.<br /><br />Aside from those and a few other minor slip ups, it's good first novel. Valerie needs to decide if she is going to write in the Cartland style or the LeCarre style. Either way, she'll be quite good once she gets settled in.";1380915736000;A good read, some errors;AETAVRPEWJEBCYA4373S7PLUVPZA;True

0544935276;192;0544935276;4.0;"This book is really about the rise of China. America is facing its first serious economic competitor since it overtook Britain in the 19th century. The US has also been the dominant power in Asia since 1945. It has fought in Korea and Vietnam and protected Taiwan, Japan, Philippines, and the sea lanes in the region. When President Xi became China’s leader in 2012, he announced that his aim was to make China great again. This has meant a more assertive China. The book is a little disappointing because it points out that both countries are on a collision course but it does not present any good options for the US.<br /><br />Graham Allison is a professor at Harvard. He reviews history and observes that when a new superpower emerges the reigning hegemonic power feels threatened and often (but not always) decides to crush the upstart before it gets too powerful. Often this results in a catastrophic war. Allison calls this the “Thucydides trap” after the ancient Greek historian. He starts with the Sparta-Athens war (431 BC - 404 BC). Sparta decided that it had to defeat Athens before it became too powerful. Thucydides tells us that war between the cities was more or less inevitable. Allison picks sixteen similar examples of great power conflicts over the last 500 years, only four ended peacefully.<br /><br />Allison describes the behavior of the US after it became the world’s leading economic power in the 1890s. This sets a worrying precedent should the Chinese choose to follow our example. America started to apply the Monroe Doctrine and regarded the Western Hemisphere as its backyard. Teddy Roosevelt made it clear to the Europeans that the US would not tolerate interference in the Americas and it would fight to protect its interests. The US threatened Britain and Germany with war. Fortunately, the Europeans backed down. China now regards the South China Sea as its backyard and has started to flex its muscles. Xi talks of “Asia for the Asians” and wants the US to withdraw its military from the region. It is not clear what happens next if we try and maintain the current status quo. Foreign policy experts such as Ian Bremmer and Robert Kaplan have advised appeasement and suggested that we should terminate our obligations to Taiwan and Japan.<br /><br />John Mearsheimer is a history professor at the University of Chicago and he has also written about China and America. Mearsheimer believes that once countries become economically dominant they seek to dominate their region militarily. He calls this “offensive realism.” The neo-cons who worked for the first President Bush wanted the US to become a global hegemon and they created the Wolfowitz Doctrine, which Allison does not mention. The doctrine wanted to prevent any new rising power becoming a rival as powerful as the Soviet Union. This is the &#34;Thucydides Trap&#34; as foreign policy. Mearsheimer predicts that China will attempt to dominate Asia so that conflict with the US is probably inevitable. This is the crucial foreign policy problem of our age, what happens in Syria is irrelevant by comparison. Allison believes that both America and China assume that they are special and inherently superior to other nations. They expect other countries to follow their lead and be submissive. This could present problems in Asia for the US. China has made it clear it does not want be part of a world order dominated by the US and its liberal democratic values. Like the US, it wants to lead.<br /><br />Allison believes that there will soon come a time when the US would probably lose a military confrontation in the South China Sea. The Chinese have developed land-based missiles that could sink America’s carriers if they get too close to the Chinese mainland. Does that mean we should respond like Britain in the early part of the 20th century and back-off? What would that mean for Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea? Allison does not offer any real answers.<br /><br />Some of Allison’s chosen historical lessons were not particularly relevant to the coming conflict with China and I often disagreed with his analysis. Allison describes WW1 primarily as a struggle between Britain and Germany. Germany’s decision to go to war in 1914 was mainly about its rivalry with Russia and maintaining hegemony over the European mainland, something Britain never had any interest in. Germany was concerned about protecting its backyard, which meant its long border with Russia. Moltke, the head of the German army, wanted to crush Russia before it was too late. The Tsar had a huge army and the country was rapidly industrializing.  Russia had always been an expansionist power. A modern Russian army would have been a real threat to Germany.<br /><br />Allison's list of key players in 1914 (e.g., Churchill, Edward VII, Bethmann Hollweg, and the Kaiser) is also wide of the mark. He focuses on Churchill, who was Britain’s navy secretary at the time. On the British side, Asquith (prime minister), Sir Edward Grey (Foreign Secretary) and David Lloyd George (Chancellor) called the shots. Grey hated the Germans and wanted to help France. Lloyd George became prime minister in 1916 and his support was needed before war was declared, the party would have split without his backing. Lloyd George sat on the fence until Germany attacked Belgium. The German chancellor (Bethmann Hollweg) did not control the army or foreign policy, the Kaiser did. The Kaiser just wanted to fight Russia. However, Moltke, who was head of the army, sidelined the Kaiser. The main objective of the German army's Schlieffen Plan was to remove the Russian threat by first attacking France and Belgium. The German army believed they could defeat the French easily, as they had in 1871, and then turn and face the Russians. Moltke was not worried about Britain’s tiny army.  Britain entered the war only because Germany invaded Belgium. The Germans feared the growing power of Russia, for them, it wasn't about Britain at all.<br /><br />Overall, the book is easy to read and very informative. What Allison makes clear is that we don't have any good options. By 1905, Britain had no economic interests in the Western Hemisphere that it was prepared to fight over, apart from Canada. It may be different for the US in Asia. If we choose to withdraw from Asia, it would raise fundamental questions about the global role of the US. We would no longer need to spend $700 billion annually on defense. This is a difficult and risky call for the US. We need a book that can hopefully explain the pros and cons of the various options.";1498055163000;The China Problem;AGE3ABEGGRYU3FVHD2M3WRSF4YAQ;True

She has lived in Cleopatra’s palace pretty much all her life but is starting to experience something different there. Lydia is a girl that Cleopatra sees as having a slight stature and petite features; she’s like a butterfly and a favorite with Caesarion. She has Samuel, but she may be about to lose him. Then she would be truly alone. She wants to feel needed and to belong, but how does a girl who feels abandoned experience that?<br /><br />It sounded to me like Lydia had an orphan’s heart during most of this story even though she had a place to live and people all around her. It was the author’s choice to make Lydia an orphan in this story because she wanted to touch on identity issues, so I think she could possibly show what it would be like for her (or for people in general) to feel like she was valued and worthwhile, or to possibly show what caused people to treat her that way.<br /><br />I understood Lydia’s need to lash out in pain at one place in the story. It must have been very hard to live under the roof of Cleopatra, going against her Jewish nature.  I thought that since Lydia thought that one of her biological parents is Jewish that possibly made her feel like she connected with Jewish people better, and it might’ve been hard to have so many people around who didn’t understand her very well.<br /><br />As always, the fictionalized versions of Biblical stories usually have a way of opening my mind up more to the Biblical account(s) in the stories.

1585100420;15;1585100420;5.0;"I started using this classic grammar online.  When I saw how inexpensive it is on Amazon, even the hardback, I had to order one.  I have enjoyed it ever since.  Even the most bizarre constructions found in Latin documents are in there someplace.  It is so full of interesting items, and lucidly explained, that I enjoy reading it regularly just to keep improving my Latin.  I even find the historical explanations valuable.  They don't necessarily improve my understanding, but I find it easier to remember forms and irregularities when I see where they came from.  For example, I learned that the ""ba"" in the imperfect tense comes from the same Indo-European forms that produced the verb ""be"" in English.<br />I'm not in a position to compare it to other grammars, so I can't call it the ""best"", but it sure works for me.  I just bought my second copy because I found myself in the United States without mine, and I needed to translate Latin documents.<br />This grammar is probably too advanced for someone who has not already studied Latin.  It helps to know English grammar too, which unfortunately even English majors don't know anymore (and shamelessly brag about).<br />If this grammar is too advanced, Oxford sells a small paperback grammar of Latin by Morwood that is very good, doesn't require as much knowledge of English grammar, and is inexpensive.<br />Finally, I can't understand why Amazon doesn't make their excellent hardback edition easier to find.  They do sell it (I just bought one), but you have to enter the ISBN number in advanced search:<br />ISBN 1-58510-042-0.<br />It's a great buy on Amazon, so don't settle for paperback.";1186762264000;An excellent Latin grammar!;AE4UWGQS2MNH62UN5TFZYHBAKP7A;True

The Berber States of North Africa claim that their faith allows them to attack anyone who does not submit to their religion. Women are sold into sexual bondage, and held for the warlords' harems. Morocco, Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli use piracy as the basis of their economies. This has gone on for centuries.Perhaps a million European Christians have been captured. Now young Lieutenant Putnam has been enlisted to join the battle. The battle for freedom and justice.<br />Putnam, just a teenage boy, will soon be growing up. Fast.

0199794049;9;0199794049;4.0;I’m reading these three books as part of an online program called “100 Days of Dante.” This program is excellent as it involves numerous scholars who provide a brief lecture on each Canto. Readers are asked to read three Cantos a week.I have been doing this as well as reading some supplementary guides to The Divine Comedy.<br /><br />There are many translations of The Divine Comedy available. Many are poetic translations. The one I’m using is a prose translation by John Sinclair. One of the reasons I chose this text is due to its bilingual format — Italian on the left page, English on the right. Another reason is that the translator has provided three or four pages of notes for each Canto. I’ve found these useful. Admittedly, by reading a prose translation I’m missing some of the great beauty of Dante’s poetic language, but I hope to make up for this by reading a poetic translation after I finish this prose one. While I have enjoyed this translation by Sinclair, I suspect there are newer and more robust translations available.;1634251431570;A solid prose translation of The Divine Comedy;AGBWJM5R6MHAGB52ZAQGFBXSBU7Q;True
0517173077;29;0517173077;4.0;"Interesting book. Yoko Ono's character here is shrewdly personified. &quot;Imagine&quot;, that she was trying to really force her 'music' (warble screetch) on to Double Fantasy. This is while she was having affairs, milking the Lennon fortune, drinking and living like a pack rat-and heavily abusing narcotics. Her songs had to be pitch shifted, note by note just to stay in the key. Sad, that Lennon would refer to her as &quot;mother' in a maternal way.I am not trying to trash Ono. Seaman's insights are vivid-in a documentary style of recorded events. One has to take notice.<br />Reading this book, you get inside Lennon's day to day behavior.<br />The Bermuda trip, is especially interesting. Here is a guy, trying to avoid the &quot;mania&quot; of fans (everywhere on the planet) and Seaman for me describes what that was really like. Upon recognition-they are in shock, then they try and get a piece of him, then Lennon moves on, oblivious to their existence and the loss of his essence, seems to be even more of a shock. Beatle mania-and Lennon awe, continued to grow in the 70's as had it first started in the early 60's.<br />I have read this book 3 times over the last 5 years, and each time it takes you to a different place. Lennon felt the Beatles peaked in 1961 and this comment, and many like this -show how good the group really was, just as they were recording those early mono albums. Raw, full of energy, romantic to the hilt, and with a backbeat you couldn't lose.<br />When Seaman is beaten by Yoko's bodygard thugs (ex-police officers) you really feel for the guy.It was more torture than just a mere beating. Further more, you certainly can empathize with Julian Lennon and even Paul McCartney who would have to deal with the calculating coldness of Yoko Ono.<br />Seamen is abit of dweep through out this narrative. (playing bongos and keeping a beat, while Lennon works out a few new songs in Bermuda.) Lennon, coming out of 5 year sleep, is full of creative juice, influenced by Bob Marley raggae to the B-52s-while covering his ears-when he hears the rock wallop and head bang of early Led Zeppelin on the radio. I am not writing this to praise Seaman but the guy should be awarded some attention for keeping diaries and copies (the originals were stolen by Yoko's thugs in a burglary) as well as his keen powers of observation, from a guy that was truly there. Right to the end of Lennon's life.<br /><br />Particularly sad is the fact, that Yoko dismissed any form of protection for John when he would walk into the Dakota Apts-which perhaps would have (think of Reagan's attempted assassination) saved his life.

It had all the makings of a novel that would interest me--atmosphere, setting, time travel, love story, history etc. Unfortunately, for me, the novel fell flat. The time travel was actually done in a rather annoying way that distracted from getting immersed in either the past or the present. It was also a bit ridiculous to think that Julia, the main character, would be wandering around in a trance in the present as she relived events happening in the past. As far as a connection to the characters, well it just wasn't there. Usually when reading a time travel romance I am aching for the hero or heroine to get back to the past or to stay in the future. In this novel I didn't much care what she chose to do as I didn't feel a strong connection between Mariana/Julia and any of the men involved.

B09F5WTT8C;1;B09F5WTT8C;4.0;"This is the third of Jennifer Ryan's novels that I've read and I enjoyed it just as much as I did her previous works.  One of the things I appreciated about this book is that, despite the similar background and setting (the home front in the British countryside during WWII) to both The Chilbury Ladies' Choir and The Kitchen Front, Ryan still managed to make this a very different story. With most of the men off fighting in the war, the women at the home front do what they can to support the war effort.  But with all the rationing taking place and the severe limitations on necessities from food to clothing, challenges abound for those trying to keep things going at home.  It is against this backdrop that we meet 3 spirited women from different walks of life who are brought together through a joint effort of wanting to help other women celebrate love by mending wedding dresses for brides across the country.<br /><br />Cressida Wescott grew up in Aldhurst village, but left when she was in her twenties due to a falling out with her brother.  After fleeing to London, she makes a name for herself as one of the country's top fashion designers — not an easy feat, especially for a single woman given the sentiments of the time and the traditions that confined most women to a life of marriage and motherhood.  All goes well until both Cressida's London home and her design house are bombed to ashes in the London Blitz and instantly, she loses everything that she worked so hard to establish.  With no other recourse, Cressida has no choice but to return to Aldhurst and stay with her niece and nephew while she rebuilds her business, all the while hoping that the two of them are kinder and more hospitable than their late father was.  While her niece Violet is thrilled that the famous aunt she never knew will be staying with them, she has her own ""trouble"" to worry about in the form of the conscription letter for war work that she receives, which effectively dashes her lifelong dream of marrying an aristocratic husband.  Meanwhile, Grace Carlisle, the local vicar's daughter, is engaged to be married and wants desperately to be able to wear her mother's wedding gown for the ceremony.  For Grace, it's a special way to remember her beloved mother, who died 10 years ago, and also her only hope for a traditional white wedding given the mandatory wartime clothes rationing, which has made wedding gowns a scarce commodity.  Unfortunately, her mother's wedding gown is too damaged to wear without repairing, so Grace brings it to her sewing club in the hopes that, together with the other ladies in the club, they are able to salvage it.  It is there that she meets Cressida, who decides to accompany Violet to one of the meetings, and as they come up with a plan to repair the wedding gown, the women also form an unexpected, close friendship.  Soon, the ""project"" of repairing Grace's wedding dress expands into the broader idea of a wedding dress exchange program where the ladies from the sewing circle mend donated wedding dresses and lend them out to other brides so they can get the chance to have a white wedding of their own.<br /><br />I loved the concept of this story and felt that Jennifer Ryan did a great job writing about the time period in a way that made me feel like I was there sharing the characters' experiences. Speaking of the characters — I also loved how, once again, Ryan's main female protagonists were all strong, admirable women who had no problem standing up against the conventions of the time. The narrative alternates between Cressida's, Violet's and Grace's perspectives, and together, we get the entirety of their shared story and experiences.  While there was a little more romance in this one than I expected, especially when compared to the previous two books of hers that I had read, it didn't overshadow the rest of the story, so I was fine with it.<br /><br />Overall, this was in the same vein of Ryan's previous two ""home front"" themed novels in that the tone was lighthearted and uplifting, though it also dealt with serious issues in a respectful, non- heavy handed way.  Having said that, I did feel that the story as a whole was a tad longer than it needed to be, especially around the midway mark, where some of the scenes felt repetitive and I felt like I was losing interest, but I kept with it and am glad I did, as the story turned out well in the end.<br /><br />I enjoyed this one and definitely recommend it, especially for fans of Jennifer Ryan's previous works about women's wartime effort on the home front.  Also if you're looking for a WWII-themed read that's resonant and poignant but not too heavy, this one fits the bill quite nicely.<br /><br />Received ARC from Ballantine Books via NetGalley.";1661222952002;Resonant and poignant, but not too heavy;AE2E4PG3IJ4NIQRKK4XF2Z7HYXMA;False

B08BZXBGYJ;13;B08BZXBGYJ;4.0;"The surgery of organ transplantation has taken off in the past fifty years. However, the ability to apply these gains to the nervous system has lagged behind due to the limitations of nerve regeneration. As told in this book, during this time, Robert White, MD/PhD, sought to pioneer head transplantation onto a new body. He was successful in transplanting a monkey’s head onto another’s body. However, he retired and died before his dream could come true.<br /><br />Schillance’s work seeks to tell his story and the story of this field. The tale is gripping, the character personalities are strong, and the stakes are high. This story is not well-known to the public as journalistically, it has mostly been covered in sensationalist news sources. Therefore, Schillance’s informative tale should reach interested ears.<br /><br />Is White a humble genius or merely a new Dr. Butcher and Dr. Frankenstein? That gripping question lies behind the historical unfolding of this work’s plot. The reader is left to make up her/his own mind. After finishing this work, I find elements of both stereotypes are true. Animals are harmed to make science advance, but noble scientific aims could save human lives. As White asks, would society rather a surgeon practice on monkeys or a human child?<br /><br />These relevant and pertinent questions bring us to today as the field has continued in White’s absence. Head transplantation is variously proposed still. A central limitation to White’s work was the inability to bring a paralyzed spinal cord to life. (Thus, the patient would always remain a paralytic.) However, in recent years, nerve regeneration technology has shown promise; additionally, some have developed technology that bypasses the spinal cord by sending signals directly from the brain to local nerve endings. Schillance accurately and excitedly exposits these developments.<br /><br />As part of the history of medicine, this work is especially relevant to historians and healthcare professionals, but it also has the chance to reach a wider general audience. Again, this story is not well-known but should be. It may enter more into society’s conversations about bioethics in coming years. Schillance casts the facts and situation well, without bias or agenda. Are we ready for the reality of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein?

(The author is accepting Hegel's belief that civilization is moving from lower, ineffective forms of civilization to more effective forms.) Fukuyama in this book is seemingly dancing on Karl Marx's grave - Marx predicted that a similar point would be reached with communism instead displacing capitalism. Obviously, China has changed the situation since Fukuyama's book, and the world is now increasingly looking at it as a model for both a superior form of government (autocratic) and economics (Socialism, with Chinese characteristics). This latest model of superiority is a hybrid of capitalism, democracy, socialism, and autocracy.<br /><br />In addition, the Chinese are also heading to a leadership role as stewards of the world's environment - something American capitalism originally led in, but is now in danger of regressing. (Yes, their current care of the environment is far worse than ours, but their trend and ours are likely to change that.)<br /><br />Some contend that democracies rarely/never go to war with each other - thus, democracy really is superior. But wasn't Hitler elected? Doesn't Israel daily practice low-intensity warfare against the Palestinians?<br /><br />Others delight in the growing number of nations with democratic practices - but we've yet to see the outcome in the Middle East. Regardless, none of them can hold a candle to China's massive and speedy improvements.

0807010669;6;0807010669;4.0;"Dating Jesus is very well written. Ms. Campbell is a bit younger than I, from a different part of the country, and of a different gender, but she is a great storyteller and her reminiscences of growing up in church were very engaging.<br /><br />I don't think she meant it to be so because she doesn't dwell on it, but the most piercing memory I took away from the book was when a normally kind Sunday school teacher publicly shamed her as a young teen, for asking too many questions about gender limitations within the church. That kind of thing sickens me. It seems not to have affected her as much as it would I.<br /><br />I wish I could endorse this book completely, but there are hindrances. The book's feminist history is not so  interesting, and I skipped the 30 page lesson near the end entirely. There are smatterings of liberal politics (stem cells, Gulf War, etc), with the assumption of their rightness, that I found distracting. And then there are theological excesses.<br /><br />I'm not completely sure, but if I could encapsulate Ms. Campbell's beliefs they would be that the Bible is paternalistic, therefore untrustworthy. She laments that Paul's theology has become so important, but then attempts to explain his words in a new light. Evidently his theology is important after all.<br /><br />There seems to be quite a bit of 'Eve guilt' - feeling gender guilt for our first mother biting down on the forbidden fruit. But the Bible actually lays the guilt on Adam more than Eve; unlike Eve, Adam knew what he was doing, and chose his wife over God. Ultimately, focusing on Adam's greater guilt only substantiates paternalism, so that wouldn't be much help to Ms. Campbell. Maybe undue Eve guilt is the cost of elevating Eve's culpability?<br /><br />At one point later on, Campbell actually exonerates Eve's sin, saying she doesn't blame her for wanting wisdom. What's so bad about that? Campbell asks.<br /><br />It was here that I felt the train finally leave the tracks. The problem with liberation theology, which places a filter based on our own needs and desires above the centrality of God's purposes in Christ, is that we distort the Gospel in order to support our theories. So toward the end, while I find Ms. Campbell's reference to God as ""her"" off-putting, I don't find it surprising.<br /><br />The irony of theological rebellion is that we don't have to leave orthodoxy to find plenty of biblical evidence that God does have female characteristics. Even Adam is not identified as a man until after Eve is formed; apparently he originally embodied the characteristics of both genders, and the formation of woman from him was more a separation/polarization than an addition, with what was taken from his side being much more than a mere rib. And one doesn't have to abandon orthodoxy to acknowledge that history has not been, and continues not to be, kind to women.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the Bible - and emphatically, Jesus himself - has given us ""Father"" as the ultimate relational descriptive of God. In my opinion, maturing in the Gospel does not entail leaving its basics behind.<br /><br />Despite these flaws, this book has value for anyone, of either gender, who has left a church for any valid reason and has bitter memories. The human side is told very well here. I'm giving this book a 7/10 (Amazon needs to wake up and expand its rating scale). Those people who were damaged by church and got fed up and left, rather than walking away from Jesus, need to sort through the situation and retain the good. They will find some good to feed on here, despite the concerns.<br /><br />I sometimes think of Zacchaeus, the tax collector in Luke 19. Jesus comes to his town, but short-of-stature Zacchaeus can't get a glimpse because of the crowd following Jesus. So, despite being a man of wealth and privilege, Zacchaeus climbs a tree for a better vantage. Jesus then invites himself to dine with Zacchaeus, but the crowd protests: he is a sinner! But Jesus knows the heart. Zacchaeus promises to offload a lot of his wealth to the poor and to rectify any past offenses. Against all conventional religious wisdom - even ""Christian"" religious wisdom - Zacchaeus is Saved.<br /><br />You see the metaphor. The church is indeed imperfect, and in our carnality we actually hinder the work of Christ. We stumble ""these little ones"" time and time again, and it is a scandal indeed.<br /><br />Blessed are those who will not allow the crowd to keep them from Jesus. If that's been happening, find yourself a tree and climb it, see Jesus accurately, do right to all men, and let no man take Christ's words of salvation away from you. He came to save not to condemn.<br /><br />Whether fundamentalist or feminist, we have to be careful about confusing our own priorities of doctrine and praxis with his. After all, the purpose of climbing the tree is to see Jesus more accurately. Ms. Campbell has done a noteworthy job telling of the church's very significant foibles, but not such a good job describing the unchanging Christ who has been revealed to us.";1249649342000;"""Dating"" is engaging";AFIHAAXYXH5IR3JVKQSJTVKCF5OQ;False

1939805007;10;1939805007;5.0;"The title Burning of Uncle Tom’s Cabin is a metaphorical message of the author’s intent to destroy the negative and stereotypical portrayals of black people in the original Harriet Beecher Stowe’s Uncle Tom’s Cabin.  Carl Waters points out in the Introduction, that although Beecher was less racist than many of her contemporaries in that she believe that black people had souls and that slavery was wrong, she believed in the superiority of white people and the inferiority of black people.  For readers of Stowe today, this view is distorted and damaging.<br /> Waters presents his own take on the original story, expanding the role of a minor character, George Harris, who refuses to accept that he is inferior or that he must remain a slave.  The story is told from the point of view of George and his wife Eliza who are admirable and courageous characters.  They take risks almost unimaginable for the sake of their love for each other and their son.  The cruelty of George’s slave owner, Frank Harris, and viciousness of the slave catchers are vivid in Water’s descriptions bringing the reader in terrifying propinquity to the horror of slavery.<br /> The story quickly drew me in and I journeyed beside both George and Eliza as they attempt to escape to Canada.  At no point did the pace of their story lag nor did I lose interest in supporting their journey.  At times the suspense was so high for me that I needed a break; but then I am considered a soft touch.  At times the naiveté and trust of Eliza seemed unrealistic; however, since it probably comes from her protected and sheltered life as a “house slave”, it is more believable.<br /> Burning Uncle Tom’s Cabin is the first of a four book series.  Waters has met his goal of creating black characters of depth and confidence while exposing the inhumanity of the institution of slavery.  He has also created a book with suspense, a compelling story and descriptions that give the reader a vivid experience of the journey George and Eliza traveled.  In the end, Waters leaves the reader eager for his next book.";1413306845000;The Metaphorical Message;AFTL3L4VRJ2YNH7V6JAKOKN7XFRQ;False

0062297228;7;0062297228;2.0;"I know I'm late to the party with this review, but as an avid Agatha Christie devotee, I thought I should leave my opinion.<br /><br />Unlike some reviewers, I actually like Catchpool. Was he the most exciting and wonderful character ever written? No, certainly not. But I appreciated the fact that Hannah tried to create her own character to play off Poirot. In all of Christie's wonderful Poirot mysteries, that cocky little Belgian needs someone-- Hastings, primarily-- to show off in front of and with whom to have a rapport. I think Catchpool achieved what he needed to in that regard.<br /><br />This Hercule Poirot was very different from the one Christie wrote. I don't think he irritated me as much as some Christie fans who have left reviews, but Christie just had this way of writing him that no one else will ever achieve, and that is that. Perhaps instead of trying to write the most beloved detective in literature, Hannah should have just created her own character. I suspect the reason she wanted to write a Poirot is because she knew it would sell like hot cakes... And it worked on me. I bought the book when I never would have if it had been her own characters.<br /><br />The thing that I just had so many problems with is the plot. It was so overly complicated. I love how clean Christie's plots were. You had great clues, and then in the Great Reveal at the end, it all just fell together. Everything was explained and you kick yourself for not coming to that simple conclusion. Hannah had no such subtle touch. The plot was way too contrived, so much was happening that I couldn't keep it all straight (and, hello, I've read every Agatha Christie; I know how to keep up with a murder mystery), and it felt very messy. At the conclusion of the book there were so many things that I felt still needed explanation. The characters weren't well developed enough, so when everyone's actions were supposedly explained, I didn't feel satisfied with the paltry answers given.<br /><br />I think the biggest mistake for me was not that Sophie Hannah used Poirot, and not that she tried to create her own Hastings-esque sidekick, but that she lacked the subtlety, cleverness, and simplicity that made Agatha Christie the undisputed Queen of Crime.";1474559868000;Messy and Contrived Plot;AHSIMJQ5BAHRBWGLMJEYPWAPHTRQ;True

However, to continue to engage readers through descriptions of tormented youth is a skill in itself, and in this respect  Akhil does not disappoint.<br /><br />Much of the book focuses on the  travails and tribulations of  immigrant Sharma family seen through the eyes of the protagonist, Akhil.  He wallows in self-pity while taking us through experiences of an Indian immigrant family in New York. And despite all odds, does well academically and is accepted into Princeton. The rest – a well paying job in investment banking etc follow.<br /><br />No doubt  Akhil and family were dealt a lemon, but as the adage goes ‘We cannot change the cards we are dealt, just how we play the hand.’  Admirable that  Akhil turned his lemon into a story, a bestseller at that!;1420386112000;If life gives you a lemon …. write a story about it;AHGIQ7RTQ2R43P6VQ5RB4EPNBBAQ;False

1599830639;0;1599830639;1.0;"First, be warned, that this book is NOT a continuation of ""I Am Your Fool"" by Jacqueline M. Smith.  This book has a totally different storyline with totally different characters.  I am not sure why the author chose such similar titles for two totally different books?!?!<br /><br />It revolves around a young lady named Destiny.  The book opens up with Destiny getting kicked out of her therapist house because she was caught having sex with the therapist's husband.  Destiny returns to the home of her boyfriend, William,  who gladly takes her back until the therapist shows up the next day to tell the boyfriend why she kicked Destiny out.  Although Destiny cries and pleads with the boyfriend, he too kicks her out.  She proceeds to get her own apartment and it seems almost immediately starts sleeping with one of her single neighbors, Eric, on a ""no strings attached"" basis - I guess this is known as 'friends with benefits' today.  Meanwhile, Destiny is intent on seeking revenge on the therapist for breaking up her relationship with William.<br /><br />Here the story starts to take a lot of twists and turns the reader can see coming a mile away which is why I gave the book such a low rating.  While Destiny and Eric start hanging out during the day and sleeping together at night, Destiny runs into a young man named Hakim.  While Hakim is upfront that he is not seeking anything beyond a sexual relationship, somehow he and Destiny become good friends without any benefits.  This part of the story was not very believable because the author went out of her way to paint Hakim as a ""love em and leave em"" player.  So his relationship with Destiny seemed totally out of place.<br /><br />To make a very long, long story short, it later appears that Hakim and Destiny are half siblings (father in common) which explains why the author avoided a sexual relationship between the two.  Hakim's father, Derrick, reunites with Destiny's mom who has had another daughter.  Of course, Derrick and Destiny's mom, Rosalee, both regret turning their back on Destiny (who was raised by her grandparents) and are both eager to make it up to her.  Rosalee, who is dying of cancer, wants Destiny to look after her younger sister, Audrey, - whom we never learn who her father is - and, naturally, Destiny is all too happy to do.  Never mind prior to this reunion Destiny hated her mother for abandoning her.  Everyone welcomes Destiny into the two families except Hakim's sister, Jasmine, who is jealous of Destiny because she doesn't want to share her father.  This part of the story didn't make a lot of sense since the author never portrayed Derrick as really spending any time with Destiny.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Destiny uses Eric and Hakim to videotape a secret lifestyle her therapist is engaged in and uses the tape to destroy the therapist's marriage along with many of the therapist's friends' relationships.<br /><br />Halfway through the book, I became totally bored with the storyline.  I had to fight very hard to resist the urge to start skipping chapters.  While the author tries to show emotional growth in the main character, it was just hard to relate to her.  On one hand Destiny couldn't get over her relationship with William but she enjoyed sleeping with Eric - every time she thought of William, she was more determined to get her revenge on the therapist.  Destiny had plenty of money inherited from her grandparents so she didn't have a job besides shopping and trying to come up with ways to exact her revenge.  Naturally, Destiny and Eric get married and they along with Audrey live happily ever after.  They are a few other dramatic events that occur within the storyline but they really aren't worth discussing and they definitely did not contribute anything interesting to the book.<br /><br />Therefore, I would not recommend this book and I am eagerly looking forward to returning it to my local library this afternoon!";1277751532000;A Total Disappointment!;AHBGI3MBOMWFSPNP3RFQDLF37V5A;False

B09LGWLBS5;0;B09LGWLBS5;2.0;I wanted to love this book. In many ways, I enjoyed it, it’s not a bad book. However, several aspects tugged down my score, and they’re mostly things that can be improved upon. As an editor, my way of reading books is a bit technical- I always notice the editing right off the bat, and it does affect my score. I suspect this book to be in dire need of a professional edit or proofread. From the table of contents alone, I spotted three issues, and several within the writing of the story afterwards. I would highly recommend a keen eye going over Ms. Strauss’ next novel, as these mistakes and flaws- to a trained eye- can be enough to jar a reader out of their reading experience.<br /> Let me start with some of the downsides to this novel, so that I can end on a good note- because there are good notes within The City of Broken Girls. My main issue came from an overall feeling of inconsistencies within the story. There were a few plot moments that made me pause and go, “Wait, that doesn’t make sense.” I always notice when a situation isn’t quite realistic or isn’t quite explained enough. Certain spots of this story felt a little too convenient, a little too plot pushed and didn’t exactly feel like a realistic way of explanation. There were some glaring plot holes that could have been adjusted with more explanation or emphasis.<br /> Particularly, I felt as though there were emotional inconsistencies within this novel. The way characters reacted, the emotions behind certain moments, I didn’t always find it to be believable, or to make sense. There were times where I felt like the writing was over dramatized, leaning into the cliche. While some people enjoy that, especially in thrillers, I personally didn’t care for it. There were times I was told the character’s emotions- but they weren’t felt in the writing itself, and I felt very little connection to them.<br /> Now onto the good aspects of this book. As a thriller, the plot is a great premise. I liked the direction it went, and the situation. As is a constant complaint of mine with novellas: I wish it had been longer, and gone into more detail. I think it takes on a very classical story of a woman scorned by a selfish man who broke her more than he thought and then lost it all when she took her revenge. I think this particular situation is a great one to base a thriller after. Some aspects of it were really unique and interesting. I enjoyed the double perspectives of the detective and the main character, giving some variety to the situation.<br /> I think that the author of this novel has a lot of promise, and that her future books will be worth reading. Considering The City of Broken Girls is a quick, easy thriller, I would say it’s a fair read as well, as long as you can overlook some editing flaws.

It starts off with a quick, engaging storyline.  The first 1/3 of the book was quite the page-turner.  Then, the story seems to switch focus from a tale of survival, to one of revenge.

0743261690;14;0743261690;5.0;Mitchell's version is not a translation -- he does not read cuneiform texts or Akkadian, Gilgamesh's original language. Instead, he bases his version of the story on the translations of several reputable scholars. He manages to stay faithful to what the general consensus on the words means so far as I can tell (for example, as I compared the translation used in the oft-cited Penguin version) but makes the language more lively, sensual, and contemporary. Mitchell is a gifted writer in his own right, and is well-known and liked translations of Rilke's works.<br /><br />Gilgamesh is one of my favorite ancient epics because it treats and depicts grief so well, so plainly and unstintingly, and also because the poem's author concludes that immortality is not possible, just a wish, a hope, a belief that I share.<br /><br />Finally, the Epic of Gilgamesh is fun to read to see where some of the ideas and stories in the Old Testament come from.

0736041850;9;0736041850;5.0;This book has been very helpful to me in free weight training to validate if I am concentrating on the correct muscles in an exercise.  The presentation is colorful, rich and engaging.  This is the only exercise book I have seen that approaches the weightlifting body from the inside-out.  In addition to the terrific musculature and skeletal diagrams on each page, the exercises are explained briefly but in sufficient detail with pointers for what to do and not do.  The most popular exercises are presented here, organized by major and minor muscle groups.<br /><br />This is not another encyclopedia full of exercises (though I find those helpful too).  This book helps make you more aware of your muscles so you have another way of visualizing correct form in an exercise.  The diagrams depict both men and women in a realistic way so both genders can benefit from the book.

0143125478;16;0143125478;4.0;Daniel Brown’s the Boys in the Boat is the story of the underdog.  It is the accomplishment of individuals, a team of working class beginners, and a country immersed in economic upheaval.  Brown writes a true story of the University of Washington rowing team, improbable winner of the 1936 Olympic medal in Berlin.  He approaches the task as journalist and historian, but the account reads like a page turning novel.<br /><br />  He examines the 1936 setting, both in Germany, and in the United States. He researches Hitler’s world and the rise of Nazi power in Europe.  He shows how Hitler and his aides manipulated the Berlin Olympics as propaganda to demonstrate to the world Germans are a superior race.  Even though the reader understands how that bad story ends, Brown, through use of plotting, builds suspense and interest, making that history a compelling read.<br /><br />  Brown describes the setting in the USA: The aftermath of The Great Depression.  He makes the pain come alive through the sad story of Joe Rantz.  When only a young child his mother died leaving a desperate father unable to care for Joe.  When the father remarried, unable to stand up to his new wife, he deserts his son. Only a child Joe must learn to completely care for himself.  His story is one of hurt, survival and victory.<br /><br />  Brown then educates the reader about rowing competition.  He discusses Britain’s predominance in the sport, where rowers came from the upper class.  He then takes the sport to America where the upper class continued to dominate east coast rowing.  And finally, Brown brings his skill to showing the reader the rag tail crew from the University of Washington who came from working class and farm backgrounds and didn’t even have matching uniforms.<br /><br />  Brown interviews Joe Rantz as an old man, who was a member of the team.  After Joe died Brown interviews Joe’s daughter Judy Willman who connected him with other members of the team, and their descendants.  Using interviews and journals from the crew Brown shows the psychological growth the rowers needed to achieve to let go of ego, submerge self, and become a team.  He reveals the love and support they gave each other which lasted well into their old age.  The experience gave each energy and confidence to succeed in other areas of life.<br /><br /> The book is based on historical research well done.  But the author does much more with the story than that.  He is a writer with knowledge of presenting setting, character, and plotting skill.  He brings history to life with empathy and insight.;1520694964111;but the account reads like a page turning novel;AGX3O6SQQM2WKLSDGTOPILERKNGA;True

He hopes to gain her trust, to get her to speak again, to save her. She, and others, make progress with Alicia extremely difficult. There are many setbacks along the way and other unexpected situations in the asylum with both staff and patients.<br /><br />Theo's story and the events happening in his personal life held my attention just as raptly as Alicia's did. His blissfully happy relationship he has with his wife is like a fairy tale, until he is hit with some shocking revelations.

Engaging from the start, it is an amazing story of finding unfailing love, peace, and belonging that seriously had me laughing and crying multiple times.<br /><br />Jennifer Rodewald has a beautiful writing style that is prose-like at times and to-the-point just when it needs to be. One paragraph could make me smile from the humor or an endearing nickname and the next paragraph could tear my heart out and bring deeper emotions to the forefront.<br /><br />The hard-working yet relaxed pace of country life is painted as a perfect backdrop for the characters’ journeys, because this book is all about the characters. It centers on a painstakingly subtle transformation; a “reclaiming”, if you will, of heritage, faith, and dreams (with the addition of a sweet love story).<br /><br />The main characters’ personalities are vibrant and endearing!<br /><br />Suzanna is someone I just want to hug! She needs it. She starts off as a prickly, though always likable, person who is deeply hurting over some things from her past. She often reacts in anger toward others to stave off the pain or prevent further rejection. As her story slowly comes to light, she begins to change because of the encouragement and no-strings-attached friendships that grow from her new neighbors, Paul and his sister, Andrea.<br /><br />Paul! He’s the quintessential country gentleman: a humble person who finds joy in his work and a man with integrity who loves his mama (and dad). Not to mention the humor and flirting he’s capable of ❤ …. But, he is not without his own flaws or difficulties. His current attitude is one resulting from growth, though, having dealt with his own struggles with pride to find peace and be settled with his home. I enjoyed the genuineness of his perspective.<br /><br />These two emotional perspectives – Suzanna’s and Paul’s – are contrasted in a way that makes them even more understandable — one outlook of questioning, searching, and subsequent pain/anger and the other of a seasoned wisdom and hope. Paul really believes in Suzanna, something that no one has done for her in far too long. He exudes a kind and grace-filled spirit, understanding the need to slowly break through her walls.<br /><br />The faith thread is never overstated, though central to the story. At the root of Suzanna’s problem is her disconnected idea of and relationship with God. When these encouraging personalities discover that this is the heart of Suzanna’s struggles, they understand it has to be addressed before healing can take place. And the way Paul — and his sister and a few other precious secondary characters — prove to be the hands and feet of Jesus in guiding Suz to Him plays out beautifully.<br /><br />I really appreciated the way this entire story thoroughly points to the fact that only God can make one whole. That knowing Jesus is not the same as having religion. That the truth is as simple as a freely offered relationship with the Savior of the world. All of this is combined with the sweetest story of romance born of friendship to make this one of my favorite books I’ve read so far this year. It’s my first novel by Jennifer, but it won’t be my last!<br /><br />Thank you to Singing Librarian Books and the publisher for providing a complimentary review copy for the purpose of a book tour.

However, by the end much (if not all) is revealed and the pieces all make sense. I thought Jack and Flo were perfectly adequate characters, but I didn't particularly identify with either of them.

0553763342;18;0553763342;3.0;I was in Mia's corner until Woody Allen. The book itself is wonderfully written. I could not put it down, but when she got to her relationship with Woody Allen and the litany of red flags that came up, I could not help but scream out loud, RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!!!  What Woody Allen did was unspeakable and the fact that people continue to work with him and that he is not in jail is disturbing and baffling.<br /><br />However, Mia bares much of the responsibility for how the whole thing played out. As a mother, your #1 priority is to protect your children. Time after time she was blatantly shown that Woody was deceitful and not to be trusted. By staying with that selfish, abusive, manipulative monster of a person, she continued to expose her children to irreparable harm. I am sure that this is something that she will never forgive herself for. I still cannot figure out why she allowed this sick dysfunction of a life to go on. It wasn't like she was dependent on him financially and he cared nothing about any of the children though she hoped he would one day (one of the first things he told her when they got together was that he did not like children...HELLO IS ANYONE HOME!!!). He did not even care for his own biological son.  All he cared about was his sick obsession with Dylan. It was easy for him to molest Dylan and then have sex with Soon Yi because in his own words, they were not his biological children. Anyone that could defend such acts is a menace to society.<br /><br />In a way it was brave of her to write this book as she was unafraid to show herself as well as others in a negative light. It will also help her children to understand her as well as their own lives better instead of hearing rumors and false stories from other people.

The first Bush presidency does mention the painful election loss. The Clinton presidency, well you would think Hillary is just the nicest person ever after reading this section of the book. There is also absolutely no mention or reference by the author to Bill's indiscretions. It is like John is re-writing history with the exception that he includes a photo of a personal letter that Bill wrote to him on page 170. Bill basically thanks John for &#34;invaluable assistance and loyal support&#34; and &#34;we will never forget your kindness. Concerning W's presidency, sufficient time is spent on 9/11 and there is mention of the painful election. It is also worth noting that this book was copyrighted in 2013, two years before White House Chef Walter Scheib died in the NM wilderness. Walter is an integral part of this book.<br /><br />I would suggest that the author write a more in depth re-write of this book. It was very interesting learning the ins and outs of the White House but again, how can you write about the Clintons and not talk about what went on under the desk in the oval office.

0743499026;7;0743499026;4.0;"This is the fifth book in the Gentle Giant series.  Humans were not the first intelligent life to develop in our Solar system.  James P. Hogan's earlier books explore in detail how a taller life form developed on Minerva.  They call themselves the Thuriens.  Minerva later became our asteroid belt.  The Thuriens left our Solar system 25 million years ago.  Humans developed on Minerva, and after a deadly war which destroyed Minerva a remnant of humanity migrated to Earth.  In these books we find that part of the reason humans have been so warlike is another branch of humanity, the Jewlense, have been manipulating the people on Earth to start wars.  Things work out.<br /><br />The first four books are nicely summarized in the prologue, the first seven pages of ""Mission to Minerva.""<br /><br />In the first chapter Victor Hunt, one of the main characters from the previous books, gets a phone call from himself from another universe, a parallel or alternate universe.  The first half of the book recounts the efforts of humans and thuriens to develop the technology to go to other universes.  This was fun and pleasant.<br /><br />The second half of the book is about a trip back in time to try and save the humans on Minerva from blowing themselves up.  There was a little more tension in this part of the story.<br /><br />My biggest complaint with the story is that right after developing the technology to go back in time to other universes they mount an expedition to do so.  It would seem that after figuring out how to do so, they could have spent some more time mastering the technology before they rushed off to Minerva.  Since they can go back in time, they could have waited another five years, or even fifty years.  They would have been better prepared and had more technology.  Because they rushed off to Minerva there was much greater tension in the story, but I felt the tension was artificially created.<br /><br />All in all it was a fun read.  If you've read the other stories in the series, and enjoyed them, this should be a fun read.";1122992145000;A pleasant way to spend the afternoon;AH4B4LZKUXV7BRAOQRFPTH5J65LA;False

0991033078;6;0991033078;5.0;I just finished this over the weekend. Crane spent many years in CT radio, and was a pioneer personality in early UHF television before heading to LA to become a star of morning radio drive time. He was also somewhat obsessed with drumming and led swing bands as a youth, in later years jamming with the likes of Buddy Rich. But acting and theater was always his desire and his charisma landed him the part in the sitcom he's most famous for after about a decade of radio hi-jinx in which his comedic talents gained him great fame. It's almost impossible, because of the tabloids, to mention his name with broaching the topic of his tragic death and the circumstances surrounding it (unlike his almost-never-mentioned efforts to turn things around and seek help.) And what makes it all the more tragic is the general disregard for his unselfish and extensive charity work and efforts to help so many other around him succeed. One might say there was overcompensation involved in this, but the extensive testimonies given in this book underline that it was more a result of his warm and giving personality. If he was such a dark figure, then why would just about everyone who worked with him, in radio, television and theater feels so strongly about how poorly his image has been tarnish by those seeking to make money off of his demise? The book is by no means apologetic for the hurtful aspects of addiction, but it also doesn't seek to exploit. Quite the opposite. Instead it is a celebration of someone who brought a lot of laughs to the world and truly lived to do so, often at great expense to himself. My only regret about this book is that it has taken so many years to give Mr. Crane the respect he so well deserves, but then again, it took so many years to culminate the interviews presented here. This is a delight for any Hogan's Heroes fan, but of interest as well to those who'd like to get to know the consummate entertainer just a bit better.;1460467350000;But acting and theater was always his desire and his charisma landed him the part in the sitcom he's most famous for after about;AHKSSRWMC7SIQHJWIJ27ESBIPMUA;True

0486498514;9;0486498514;5.0;I bought this book out of curiosity for my book collection. It turned out to be a very interesting reading on the topic.<br /><br />It covers, in a kind of unified way, Euclidean and non-Euclidean Geometries, Analytic Geometry, the role of Geometry in Physics, Projective Geometry, some Differential Geometry and some Topology.  The presentation blends the exposition of ideas with  historical facts making it easy and entertaining to read and follow.  To be honest, this came as a big surprise to me for the following reason: The author uses (the very short) Chapter 1 instead of a Preface to the book. He entitles it `One Book and Three Metaphors'. After reading it, I did understand his plan (and his metaphors) but I found Chapter 1 to be silly and superficially written. Other people may like it but, for some reason, I hated it! I thought that the author did not really know to write well and, if he could not make an exciting use of metaphors, imagine what failure would be his writing on the technical material. Yet, I could not be more wrong! As I kept reading, I liked the writing more and more. I liked the way he makes connections among the various topics and the way explanations are presented. Without any doubt the author understood Geometry deeply. Any reader (from high school students and above) will benefit greatly from this book which I certainly recommend strongly.<br /><br />However, this book is not a textbook. Therefore if you are looking on a book that is a standard text on any of the topics covered in it --- synthetic Euclidean Geometry, non-Euclidean Geometries, Projective Geometry, Analytic Geometry and especially Geometry in Physics, History of Geometry, Differential Geometry, or Topology --- this is not what you should buy and read. The first four topics are covered relatively extensively, the next two less extensively and the last two very little. The coverage, although robust and precise when necessary, is also more relaxed than the coverage of a dedicated textbook and often a discussion or proof mixes ideas from more than one topic.<br /><br />Overall, no matter who you are --- knowledgeable in math or a beginner, you will benefit from reading this book. However, if you are a beginner keep in mind my second paragraph, until you learn to recognize the conventional borderlines of the various areas of geometry.;1365275519000;Not a standard text but a really good one;AHIEK2LXX7MLWEELRXQK3UJM4KIQ;True

1940419107;0;1940419107;4.0;I don’t read a lot of thrillers, but, after seeing the cover of Eating Bull, I had to know what it was all about, especially the title.  I discovered an extremely well-crafted medical/psychological thriller that tackles the subject of obesity and the food industry’s role in this serious health problem.<br /><br />Set in Cleveland, Ohio, the story focuses on Jeremy Harjo Barton, an obese teenager, whose home life has without question contributed to his condition. His single mom, Connie Barton works two jobs and brings home greasy take-out every night. His agoraphobic grandfather spends his time berating Jeremy’s size and habits. It’s no better at school, where he’s harassed because of his weight. Now his health has become a bigger problem. At three hundred and ten pounds, Jeremy can hardly get around without reaching for his inhaler. He finds his only solace in playing his favorite video game, War of the Wilderness, with a stash of chips and candy bars at his side.<br /><br />Desperate for a solution, Connie takes Jeremy to see Sue Fort, a nurse at the local health department, hoping Sue can help Jeremy lose weight. With Sue’s guidance and support, Jeremy seems to be on the right track.  Small successes are good, but Sue sees a much bigger picture and urges the family to join her in a lawsuit against the food industry. Once in, Jeremy and Connie quickly learn what being at the center of this lawsuit means: a great deal of media exposure, particularly for Jeremy. Sue’s already in the hot seat at work for other controversial decisions. This lawsuit and exposure may be more than she can handle.<br /><br />There’s a much bigger problem, however. A psychopath is lurking in the community. The self-named Darwin is on a sinister mission to kill as many obese people as possible, guided by a voice within him whose mantra is survival of the fittest. Darwin attacks his victims with an alarmingly vicious ferocity, making his hate clear. Once Jeremy’s story hits the news, Darwin knows what he has to do.<br /><br />As the plots develop and threaten to merge, Rubin uses her keen understanding of human behavior to fill in the details and back stories, making Eating Bull more than just a mystery. A look at Darwin’s childhood offers an explanation but not an excuse for his actions. Rubin has also mastered the ability to describe situations through her characters’ points of view. Darwin’s hatred and contempt for the overweight comes through loud and clear. Jeremy’s teenage perspective is also realistic and telling.<br /><br />Eating Bull is also a thoroughly hip story, with teenagers, marital conflict, and local color built into the plot, including a great deal of subtle commentary and humor. Small descriptions of décor and atmosphere enhance the reader’s understanding of the scene, some of it tongue-in-cheek. One of my favorites refers to a meeting in attorney Sammy Sanchez’s office:<br /><br />“A cloud of vanilla-scented mist sprayed from an automatic air-freshener on a shelf behind him.”<br /><br />Regarding the problems of obesity, Rubin tackles the question of who’s to blame with fairness. Good and bad characters raise valuable points on both sides of the argument, which keeps the story from becoming preachy.<br /><br />As the story continues, Rubin introduces a number of shady characters with alarming traits and makes the reader question just who Darwin could be. Early clues tempt the reader to guess, but a full read is required for the story to play out to its wild and satisfying finish.<br /><br />A great suspenseful read wrapped around an important social and health issue.;1455919126000;Lots of twists in this medical thriller!;AEFKRZC4CY5VS4BBJANSBG5MTUWQ;True
0143034901;1;0143034901;5.0;Enchanting and suspenseful. The milieu of mid century Barcelona along with the gothic nature of the story blend together to form an intriguing ambience that sets this apart. The suspenseful plot works due to the unusual parallelism technique that strings a pair of stories along similar paths.<br /><br />Daniel is afflicted by two kinds of love. One literary and the other amorous. He is driven by these two desires. The result is a fascinating story populated by colorful and memorable characters.<br /><br />The only weakness to the story is the nature of his literary desire isn't properly established. There is a book that beguiles him, but we don't really get much insight into why that is so. The book is alluded to, but there isn't much presented to help the reader understand why he would be so intrigued by it. In contrast, his amorous desires are substantiated, so we understand why he is led down those paths.;1414809348000;The Shadow of the Wind;AE4IYFTVONDAK2IQB3CXB5BPA4KQ;True
0375701494;0;0375701494;4.0;I enjoyed “Old School” a lot.  Wolff is an excellent writer.  His style reminds me of English writers, as did the boarding school setting.  Reading it brought back memories of being in college and finding books just like this one when avoiding my regular studies.  There is an air of nostalgia and literary romance.<br /><br />I loved the way Wolff brought in Robert Frost and Ayn Rand as characters, along with Hemingway.  Really compelling stuff and lots of fun.  His Rand caricature was spot on with what I imagined while reading her biography.<br /><br />My only problem with Wolff is that this seems to be a novella stretched out or short stories merged together.  The ending section seemed to be contrived, almost like he needed more length to call it a novel.  I also think that Wolff’s style is very short-story-like.  Everything is tightly controlled and manipulated.  I’d like to see what he could do if he stretched out and maybe lost some of that control to the advantage of open space and dynamics.<br /><br />All that said, Wolff is a helluva a writer.  Intelligent but eminently readable and likable.;1418758824000;Loved it;AGKB2OX4T3MGX5LOJ5BRUGNYUJVA;False

0062007203;2;0062007203;2.0;"This wasn't really a book for me, hence the low rating. I mean, I don't care much about music. Or about celebrities. And I don't fantasize about meeting rock stars or other celebrities. So, why did I pick up this book? I'm not sure. It seemed like a nice and light read, is all I can say.<br /><br />Other than that, the writing was so  loud. So terribly loud, that I almost could not follow along with the roller-coaster language assaulting my brain. Written in a language that is not mine (I mean, culturally - New York style, I guess), I had a hard time getting into this story. I have the feeling the writing relaxed later on, or maybe I got used to it by then.<br /><br />Then the profanities: there is an abundance of them in this book, especially at the beginning. I don't like that sort of language if it happens all the time, so I felt uncomfortable with that.<br /><br />But when Hazel wasn't cursing away with her friends, she was a nice person. Nothing like the brain-dead women you may encounter in some chick-lits and she was reasonably normal about meeting and dating a rock star. Of course, initially, she was all ""Wow, it's him! {profanities} I want to kiss him!!"" but she settled down soon enough and didn't let her star-struck brain take over. She treated him almost like she would any other person, which I liked about her. I could also understand why she might jeopardise her relationship with the dependable Wylie: sometimes you have to go beyond what you know to find out what you really want.<br /><br />All fine so far. But some of the story was plain boring and 20 pages from the end, I was wondering whether this was it, when there suddenly was a twist to the story that I hadn't seen coming and that hadn't been sufficiently hinted at earlier on in the story. It was too sudden and that didn't feel right.<br /><br />The rock star was a rather card board cut-out type of guy, I never really got to understand what Hazel liked about him other than his music (is that enough to be infatuated with someone?). I could take him or leave him, he was nothing special in my eyes.<br /><br />So, altogether not a fantastic reading experience for me.

1631525654;0;1631525654;5.0;I must admit I have now read and re-read “The Greek Persuasion” more times than I can count, and have been seized by its story every single time. An intricate novel spanning three-generations of women and more than two continents, “The Greek Persuasion” is a tale of love and identity that is both honest and unapologetic in how it raises the struggles faced by the turn-of-the-21st-century Western middle-class woman. Narrated in the inquisitive, reflective and often downright hilarious voice of Greek-American college professor Thair Mylopoulos-Wright, the novel explores questions of love, sexuality and identity as its first-personal protagonist writes her mother’s, her grandmother’s and her own story. Robeson takes you to the coasts of Greece and California with images so vivid you can almost feel yourself swimming with Thair in the Aegean, driving away from “suburbia hell” after a fight with her mom, and being caught by a student leaving a bar in the gay hub of San Diego. The novel is a riveting journey taken by a mind refreshingly unafraid to ask the questions many of us ask (no matter how seemingly small), and to challenge the categories with which we define ourselves— even when it involves digging into the very roots of family history and the ancient myths that make it up. An absolute delight to read—I truly could not recommend “The Greek Persuasion” more highly.;1564968679358;An absolute delight to read—could not recommend it more highly.;AHQBFQYTFBXO36BELUMLRU6Z53FQ;False

0743544838;18;0743544838;4.0;Salaam ...<br />This is a great course, but it really needs a sequel (or two).  About 2/3 of the way through it, I also started working with a tutor.  She was able to clear up some of the minor points I was missing (e.g. some of the pronunciation issues I was having).  The biggest drawback of the Pimsleur method is the lack of a written text (even transliterated) or vocabulary list to refer to.  That said, however, the course is great for independent study, especially by those of us who spend too much of our lives inside a 4-wheeled commuter box.<br /><br />Some folks have tried to compare Pimsleur with Rosetta Stone.  Don't bother.  That's like trying to compare horses to cats.  They are completely different animals.  My preferred method is to do Pimsleur first in whatever language you're trying to learn.  At least do Level One.  This will give you a feel for how the language sounds and fits together, making further study more productive.  THEN you will find Rosetta to be much more helpful.  Rosetta will clear up whatever lingering pronunciation mysteries you may have, address reading and expand your vocabulary.  Use both systems, but do the Pimsleur first, IMHO.;1275730658000;Great little course, needs more ...;AF5SOXHFIXVH6XTAAPZE2C5X5HCQ;True

What an exciting honor!<br /><br />Being a lover of Princess Jellyfish and its unique story line that avoid most of the tropes and cliches seen in many manga, I was excited to learn about this never series being serialized in English. After seeing some of the reviews about it, as well as getting a chance to sample it, I was a bit unsure at first if it would be quite on par with Princess Jellyfish. While the stories are both very different (and rather unique), after finishing this volume, I am definitely invested! I will be adding this one to my Higashimura collection and already have the second volume in my shopping cart!<br /><br />This book is about a girl named Rinko, 33 years old, who works as a scriptwriter for various web series. Oh and she's getting to that age where she worries about not ever getting married, and her friends are in a similar boat. When a young man begins to point out that they are &#34;ladies&#34; and not &#34;girls,&#34; and that they are just a group of &#34;What if's,&#34; Rinko falls even further into her slump of aging. &#34;Tarareba,&#34; as defined in the novel, means &#34;what if,&#34; and that's where Rinko's problems lay. She wonders &#34;what if I dated this guy&#34; &#34;What if I didn't go out with the girls,&#34; &#34;What if&#34; this, and &#34;what if&#34; that. She soon finds that questioning things is a lack of taking action, and not taking action is what puts her in the situation she finds herself in as a 33-year-old woman!<br /><br />While the beginning was a bit off-putting (I wasn't really sure what to expect from this manga), I was quickly immersed and some of the twists I was hoping for went in the right direction. I love the humor Higashimura uses (I find myself chuckling aloud often). One word of caution: This is for a bit of an older demographic, so it may just not be your thing. I am married but close to the age of the main character and can empathize with her situation to some extent. Despite this, the sexual tension, visual and verbal humor, and the story itself have really blown me away! The end of this manga has me itching for more, and also wondering if Rinko will ever find happiness in life without marriage...or perhaps one day she will find the right man!";1531157822442;A Little Unsure At First, But Princess Jellyfish Writer Akiko Higashimura Does Not Disappoint!;AHDDXA7EQMU35XGB6C6UAFXWG35Q;False

1780766904;1;1780766904;5.0;This book was a fantastic surprise!  I knew about Francis Partridge, but didnt realize her depth of awareness, ability to observe and to put down on paper accurate and very insightful portrayals of the people she met.  She is very honest but never bitchy or spiteful. I learned much about the period at HamSpray where Bloomsbury twosomes, threesomes, and alternating foursomes of friends, wives, and lovers seemed to flourish along with the artistry.  Lytton Strachy was a very frail and brilliant biographer who created a new way of chronicling the lives he wrote about. His fame led him to create a home with the woman who loved him completely, Dora Carrington.  She was only happy with him, and they truly needed each other. Lyyton had to have his romances, though, being homosexual, and when he fell in love with Ralph Partridge, Ralph fell in love with Carrington and rather than lose him, Carrington married him to keep him at Ham Spray with Lytton, even though she did not love him.  This didnt really work and everyone was usually in an uproar about something or someone until Ralph met and fell in love with Francis.  Not only was she a wonderful influence on Ralph, she was unusually understanding about the situation with the Ham Spray residents and unbelievable patience.  Because of that I thought that she might be lacking in character or strength.  But this book makes it clear that she was neither weak or dumb.  She was someone without judging or holding people up to any kind of standard, understood human nature. Her effect on the household brought peace and real affection which helped immeasurably when Lytton had cancer and died.  Carrington could not live without him and shot herself two months after his death.  She wrote that she could not imagine a life waiting for him to come back to her.  There is a great movie called Carrington which portrays much of this very well. If you like experiments in living, the twenties, bloomsbury or bohemian life, this is a wonderful read.;1513114387454;The title says it all;AGHKVSH65P6M3HO432I7OZI25Y5Q;True

I'm generally not a fan of memoir; with the exception of 2-3 favorites, I find them for the most part to be tedious and self-promoting. This memoir is anything but. Powerful, moving, poignant. Olmsted's command of words and narrative is striking, while the story itself is a stunning testament to the power of love, family, and transformation...gut-wrenching, heart-breaking, and told with such raw honestly, humility, and authenticity. By weaving threads of stories from his family's past throughout, he offers a multi-dimensional layer to the text (I found those pieces of his story to deliver some of the most potent effects). Olmsted tells of painful and traumatic moments with sometimes subtle, and sometimes not-so-subtle, grace and humor (yes, humor!), touching the core of humanity in each of us. In my opinion, this work defies the conventions of its genre. I believe it has the power to open hearts, dispel prejudices, build bridges of compassion and understanding, and ultimately, change lives.

0373218761;132;0373218761;5.0;"As a relatively new fan of Nora Roberts, I have made it a mission of mine to acquire all of her classic novels, the ones written before I discovered this amazing author about five years ago.  I have enjoyed every story I have managed to get my hands on, but the two tales in ""Born O'Hurley"" really stand out for me.  The O'Hurley family consists of two entertainer parents who live their life on the road, an older brother, and fraternal triplets Chantel, Abby, and Maddy.  Nora has created a wonderfully complex, vital, and compelling family in the O'Hurleys, and they had me hooked from the very first page!<br /><br />The first of the O'Hurley triplets to have her story told is Abby, the quiet but strong middle (by just a few minutes) sister.  After a difficult and unhappy first marriage to well-known racecar driver Charles Rockwell, Abby has been left a widow struggling to raise her two sons on a small farm in Virginia.<br /><br />But the steady routine of her life is irrevocably changed when author Dylan Crosby comes into her life to write the biography of her deceased husband.<br /><br />Dylan soon finds he is far more interested in the lovely Abby than in the job he came to do, and he becomes determined to discover who she truly is.  Because if Abby really is the honest, kind, and determined woman she seems to be, she is everything Dylan has ever dreamed of but never hoped to find.<br /><br />Roberts has written a wonderful tale here, filled with powerful emotions, captivating romance, and engaging characters.  ""The Last Honest Woman"" is truly a Nora Roberts gem.<br /><br />The second half of ""Born O'Hurley"" delves into the life of the youngest triplet, Maddy O'Hurley.  Maddy is an incredibly vibrant and open young woman, and she is a character you can't help but love.  After leaving her role as the lead of a Broadway hit, Maddy has taken on a new and challenging role in another musical.<br /><br />And when Maddy meets the financial backer of the production, Reed Valentine of Valentine Records, she finds herself drawn to him.  Reed and Maddy are polar opposites in almost every way.  He's conservative and completely focused on business, she's full of life and colour and wears her emotions on the surface for the world to see.<br /><br />And though Reed finds himself irresistibly attracted to Maddy, he has a troubled past and issues with trust that stem from his childhood. So while Maddy has fallen head over heels in love with Reed, she realizes that he may never be able to overcome his past and give her what she needs, his heart.<br /><br />Both the effervescent Maddy and the reserved Reed will pull at your heart and you will feel for each of them as they struggle to find a way to each other.  Infused with sizzling romance, energetic dance sequences, and the family unity and dynamics that Nora is such a master of ""Dance to the Piper"" is a triumph.<br /><br />""Born O'Hurley"" comes with my top recommendation so if you've never read the stories of Abby and Maddy, buy this delightful omnibus today.  I've also had the chance to read the other two O'Hurley novels; Chantel's tale in ""Skin Deep"" and the prodigal brother Trace's story in ""Without a Trace"" and they are equally wonderful.  Look for them to be re-printed in ""O'Hurley's Return"" in February 2005.<br /><br />I promise that you will love this incredible family as much as I do, so don't miss out on getting to know them!";1092608854000;Absolutely Fabulous Classic Nora Roberts!;AETHHM4NWHSXI7P4H6Q6JM5EWAYQ;False

Unfortunately, that never happened. He has learned things no man of the 20th century would every need to know. How to fight using a claymore and fight to the death for the clan. He has been on a quest for two years looking for the magic stone that will let him go home to Chicago.  He has been told it is in Castle Carlisle.<br />Anna MacDonald is the bastard daughter of the now King, Robert the Bruce. She has only meet him once and then he didn't remember her name. But she longs for her father to be proud of her. She has agreed to marry a man he wants for political reason. Then she is kidnapped and David offers to help save her with her Uncle and Cousin. No one could for see the danger that David and Anna will face trying to get to the Castle on time for the wedding.

1591844932;2;1591844932;5.0;"THE CLICK MOMENT: SEIZING OPPORTUNITY IN AN UNPREDICTABLE WORLD (Portfolio Harcover) by Frans Johansson deals with the fact that every great company and career usually has one defining moment when luck and skill collide; i.e., the click moment.<br /><br />The author uses countless examples to show where this has happened and, also, he shows how readers can attempt to make such a moment happen.<br /><br />His basic premise is this:<br /><br />* Success is random, far more random than we have come to believe. The second [idea to keep in mind] is that there are a number of specific actions that individuals and organizations can take to capture randomness and focus it in our favor.<br /><br />For example, he cites the example of Starbucks:<br /><br />* His biggest revelation, however-the one that made him really stop and take notice-came when he tasted a café latte for the first time. The barista pulled a shot of espresso, steamed a frothy pitcher of milk, poured the two together into a cup, and put a dollop of foam on the top. Schultz was floored by what he tasted. It was, he said, ""the perfect drink."" He realized that despite his employers' expertise in all things coffee, they had missed something huge. Starbucks had it all wrong. Selling equipment and grinding coffee by the bag wasn't the big opportunity. Coffee was meant to be a communal experience, to be shared with friends, not consumed in private. ""It was like an epiphany,"" he said. ""It was so immediate and physical that I was shaking."" And that was when he realized: no one in America knows about this.<br /><br />I also liked the story that was a big reason behind the success of JAWS:<br /><br />* Spielberg said, ""The shark not working was a godsend. It made me become more like Alfred Hitchcock . . . when I didn't have control of my shark it made me kind of rewrite the whole script without the shark. Therefore, in many people's opinions the firm was more effective than the way the script actually offered up the shark."" Spielberg was forced to develop a solution, not because he planned it a certain way but because he had to try something different. The shark not working had an unintended consequence-it made Jaws a much better, more suspenseful movie.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the section toward the end that offered advice on how to harness a click moment. Though I'm not sure that it's quite as easy as: 1. Starting to bet--purposely; and 2. Embracing the radomness, I do think that Johansson's ideas are both thought-provoking and worth trying.";1350737366000;Every great company and career usually has one defining moment when luck and skill collide..the click moment.;AHGVJYWENROS7VCYCXZ4CUXGE36A;False
0688085008;15;0688085008;5.0;"Anyone who has ever read ""The Power of Now"" by Eckhart Tolle would likely appreciate this book. Although the heroine, Vasilisa, never denies her grief and despair, she graciously accepts whatever Life presents her with; as a result, she is richly rewarded. Near the end, she is perfectly happy and content with a life situation that is hardly glamorous. She is truly a light in the world and the most spiritual heroine I've ever encountered in a story for children. I've never seen my daughter so drawn to a character in a book. Vasilisa's strength comes from within and the message in this story is timeless. The doll is  a beautiful symbol of the power of a quiet yet powerful love. Unlike most fairy tales the doll is always with Vasilisa as a constant reminder of her deceased mother's love and is actively engaged as a guiding force in her life. This book could be helpful to a child who has lost a mother.  My daughter was not scared by the story or the illustrations. Recently, I purchased a book ""coincidentally"" from Amazon by Kris Waldherr, ""Embracing the Goddess Within"".

I don't know how Amazon does it (and I don't want to know; I'm content to keep it as a mystery) but they manage to bring my attention to books that are perfect companions to ones I've already bought or previewed.<br /><br />Last but not least, Mayer and Craft are a dynamic duo.

0226458083;1;0226458083;4.0;"Thomas Kuhn, through the concept of paradigm shift, has demythologized science as an accumulation of knowledge through smooth progress. That, for Kuhn, is just normal science, the incremental progress within the limits, biases and assumptions of a paradigm. For him, a paradigm is a set of accepted practices within the scientific community, the scientific traditions the scientists have grown up with. For him, ""The success of a paradigm... is at the start largely a promise of success discoverable in selected and still incomplete examples. And ""Normal science consists in the actualization of that promise.""<br /><br />Though Thomas Kuhn focused on the Copernican Revolution, for me the Quantum Revolution is a more poignant example of paradigm shift. And the latter, like the former, starts with inexplicable phenomena. When the traditional electromagnetic theory of Maxwell's Equations couldn't explain black body radiation, Boltzmann and then Plank developed a set of equations with quantized energy levels to explain the phenomena. Later, Niels Bohr formulated the quantized levels of atoms to explain their discrete emissions.<br /><br />As Kuhn says, ""When, in the development of a natural science, an individual or group first produces a synthesis able to attract most of the next generation's practitioners, the older schools gradually disappear."" In this case, Bohr persuaded his colleagues about the new view and pushed quantum mechanics into the forefront, securing it as the dominant theory in modern physics. But there were oppositions. Even Einstein, who proposed the quantization of light, could not accept the probabilistic nature of matter-energy as described by the Uncertainty Principle. For him, ""God does not play dice.""<br /><br />The shift from Newtonian mechanics to quantum mechanics is a shift from a deterministic view of the universe to a probabilistic one, a change of beliefs and values. For Einstein and others, accepting quantum mechanics seemed like returning to the pre-scientific age, where a person, even a scientist, couldn't quantify and analyze and predict natural events. When the way of doing science changes, so do the tools. Whereas calculus was the mathematical tool of Newtonian mechanics, statistics and transforms, Fourier or others, and the related group theories are those of quantum mechanics. And we know, even outside of science, that using different tools creates different results.<br /><br />For Kuhn, ""Paradigms may be prior to, more binding, and more complete than any set of rules for research that could be unequivocally abstracted from them."" So the preferences toward a deterministic worldview and the corresponding tools predisposed scientists to solve those problems with a well-defined solution. Motion under gravitational and electromagnetic forces in the macroscopic world. On the other hand, the preference toward a probabilistic worldview and the corresponding tools predispose scientists to focus on the uncertain boundaries between matter and energy, space and time, position and momentum, and energy and time. And so, ""one of the things a scientific community acquires with a paradigm is a criterion for choosing problems that, while the paradigm is taken for granted, can be assumed to have solutions."" Following the Quantum Revolution, scientists developed quantum electrodynamics (QED) and quantum chromodynamics (QCD) through normal science. But when string and other theories begin to emerge, scientists must again reevaluate their models and even more importantly their practices and worldviews.<br /><br />Through The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, we begin to see scientific progress's jagged path and appreciate the subjective parts of doing science. And instead of worshiping science, we take on the scientific mindset of observing phenomena and analyzing data and revealing biases and modifying models.";1376607452000;Normal Science vs. Paradigm Shift;AG5WZYLFNJSEFNS4YCNFKBHJKQ6Q;False

Nor do the ""wannabes"" understand why they liked or disliked a novel they had recently read.  Chances are the books they enjoyed followed the steps Darcy explains in this practical guide, while the ones that were not enjoyable lacked compelling structure.<br /><br />I consider this an expert training manual for anyone who wishes to write a novel. First-timers should read it from start to finish getting the overall picture. Then they need to go back and work through each section.  Of course this will take time.

0385517238;5;0385517238;4.0;Some Grisham fans may not enjoy non-fiction. At times the story gets a little tedious and bogged down. Overall I found the story compelling and disturbing. A one time all-star ball player becomes a miserable wreck of a person. He is suffering from mental illness and alcoholism and is targeted by local law enforcement for a murder he did not commit. His friend, who is a high school science teacher, was merely guilty by association. It is reprehensible that so many people in the criminal justice system dishonored the constitution. Their conduct was egregious. Fact is stranger than fiction. This was a great story that needed to be told and John Grisham tells the story in a passionate manner.;1163277644000;Disturbing;AEQY5LB7DD463FZXHIWBER7DHFWA;False

B00O0DPBMK;3;B00O0DPBMK;5.0;"From Goodreads:<br />Moon Dragon, A Samantha Moon Vampire for Hire novel<br />by J.R. Rain<br /><br />Tried to write a nice long review of this novel this a.m., but Firefox crashed half way through. I was traumatized. So, here I am back at it -- but I'll be more brief than if the crash had not happened!<br /><br />I've said before that J.R. Rain's writing has a way of keeping the reader involved and reading, beginning to end. This 10th novel in this series is no different -- I started it in the evening of October 17th and finished it in the evening of October 18th. I was absolutely not ready for it to end.<br /><br />This adventure delved deeper into Samantha's journey of self-discovery. More awareness of how she is changing, losing compassion, feeling aloof or isolated, and also more understanding of the entity which dwells within her, and how her control or non control of said entity is affecting her hold on her humanity. But we also see how her condition has affected her relationships with her family, with Kingsley, with Alison, with Fang, with the Librarian, and with the being into which she transforms, the great winged bat known as Talos. We see more of how her condition affects her work, what she has taken for granted, what she seems to be losing, what she seems to have forgotten. We see her struggles with her children as their own preternatural powers progress, and as they realize more and more about exactly what their mother is and what dangers she sometimes faces. And along with all of that, we see her undertake a case to find a werewolf, who just happens to be the current boyfriend of her late husband's mistress, before he kills another innocent, and how all that other stuff we're seeing almost costs her life and the life of the person she is trying to save. Lots and lots packed into a nice, efficient plot.<br /><br />Oh, and let's not forget that along the way she meets her dark master's long ago lover, the world's first vampire. And, because of that meeting, she realizes that she has powers of which she was not previously aware.<br /><br />I saw no grammar, proofing or editing errors. I saw nothing that stopped my progress in the storyline. In fact, the only thing I did see that I wondered about was the mention of &#34;sherbet ice cream.&#34; I'm not an ice cream expert -- although I am a great fan -- but I do think that sherbet and ice cream are two very different products. Is there some hybrid I don't know about? If so, someone please clue me in!<br /><br />What I did see was more and more of the things that I like about Rain's style of writing. Lots of tongue in cheek humor, such as is found at the end of of chapter 13. Sam has just transformed into the Talos: &#34;And spread my wings wide.<br /><br />Now, I thought, as I caught a hot gust of wind and sailed out over a dark valley, Where did I park my car...?&#34;<br /><br />Rain also sprinkles pop culture references generously throughout his work. Of course, Sam's favorite, Judge Judy, appears on the first page (er, screen, as Rain's series is only published digitally) of the first chapter. He also mentions the TV series &#34;The Vampire Diaries,&#34; and the original series of novels on which the tv series is based. That series was written by L.J. Smith, but that Rain has published a novel in, also. He also mentions the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, The Hunger Games Trilogy, and of course, that series' heroine, Katniss Everdeen. He mentions Hot & Now Pizza from Little Caesar's (a favorite around my house). And he also mentions other popular authors, such as Anne Rice, Poppy Z Brite and E.L. James. For me, these references simply cement the fiction to reality, and whether it's good style or or not, it makes me a happy reader.<br /><br />So, I'm looking forward to novel #11, Moon Shadow, which the end of this novel promises is &#34;coming soon!&#34; And, of course, the very title has Cat Stevens' song, Moonshadow, as my new earworm. As Rain is a prolific writer (check out his website at www.jrrain.com for his various series, stand alone novels, shorts and collaborations), I know I won't have to wait too long.";1419808728000;Samantha Moon is back!;AG732NMEFR6J3R3AGCAPAVGWWAIQ;True

Only one or two things stand in his way..<br /><br />1. The bride hates him on site.. well she doesn't hate him but is in love with another man.<br /><br />2. He has met the vision.. the woman who could possibly be the one to make him stand for love.. only to find out that..<br /><br />Diana Wylder, the youngest of the Wylder girls. The one to race headlong into life has finally realized that her luck has run out. One too many wild adventures, bad choices and less than proper men in her life. Her family has decided upon a groom for her and she really doesn't have a choice. Only problem is..<br /><br />1. The man makes boring look exciting. Caught up in himself, his position and his society all he wants to do is his duty and Diana isn't really even allowed an opinion of her own.<br /><br />2. On their very first meeting in the park, he left her alone, standing there by. her. self.. so he could discuss business. And when he did she met the man she could love forever.<br /><br />While Diana and Sheffield are wonderfully written characters and the way they face their struggles is admirable.. I was often angry at the way Diana's family treated her. Constantly telling her that love would come later, ok I get that but not seeing what the prig of all prigs was doing to her. I was sure eventually we were going to see her battered and abused. This man, had all the tendencies of an abusive mate. While it didn't ever come to that, I kept waiting. And it made my stomach clench. First because I was sure he was going to and second because her family all but condoned it.<br /><br />While Sheffield is portrayed as a loveable rake who might need to be reigned in a bit. He was also charming, considerate and open to falling in love. He never stated that he would treat his wife with anything less than respect, that he would be unfaithful, he just wanted a marriage like his parents had, a love match, until then he was having fun. To see everyone treat him as the charming rogue but never the right one for Diana was equally frustrating.<br /><br />I guess, that while the lead characters were exceptional the secondary characters ruined this book for me. I wanted to like it, there was so much potential there but the attitude of all these people who were supposed to ""love"" them was horrid. This wasn't a bad book, I just won't recommend it. It grated on me.. I wish Ms Bradford had chosen a different form of tension for this couple. Some other obstacle to overcome.<br /><br />Maybe I am just getting too picky.. but there you have it<br /><br />Shauni<br /><br />This review is based on the ARC of When the Duke Found Love provided by netgalley";1354005194000;When the Duke Found Love, A Review for the Blog Tea and Book;AGXCQEBVPWPDRAJWYOO4B2ISGWKA;False
0803736991;0;0803736991;5.0;Okay, was this book perfect?  Hells no!  There were elements I felt could have been better handled, so it's probably better rated as a 4.5 star book, but I'll get into that later.<br /><br />Here's why I lovingly stroked and petted and hugged and, yes, eventually kissed this book.  Huntley Fitzpatrick creates the most awesomest awesome characters ever!  Seriously, no joke.  Our MC, Samantha, is so relateable and vulnerable and true, I felt as though she encompassed bits of every girl (myself included) I had ever known during my high school years.  Sure, she's rich, so maybe we can't all relate to that, but she's flawed in the right ways and never entitled.  Her family dynamics are, well, complicated and tense.  It stands to reason that these dynamics are mirrored in Samantha's relationship with her best friend, Nan.  To steal a line from The Perks of Being a Wallflower, we accept the love we think we deserve.  And very shortly into the novel we begin to understand that the relationship between Sam and Nan is less than balanced.<br /><br />Jase, the boy next door, is so swoon-worthy I wanted there to be a sequel, just so I could read more about him.  But it's not about the sinewy muscles or the Ken doll good looks, though it doesn't hurt that he's smokin' hot.  No, it's more than that - Jase is as genuine a human being as I've come across in my many years of reading.  He is kind and thoughtful, he is smart and capable and loving.  He is all the things missing in most love interests these days.  There's no angst, no bad boy swagger, no I-hate-you-love-you attitude, just simple honesty and tenderness.  Just what a first love should be.  And, yes, this book is all about first love and coming of age.<br /><br />This time, I don't want to write a review full of spoilers. This time, I don't think I could adequately do a book justice by trying to dissecet its many elements.  This time, I want to leave these discoveries untouched.  Nope, this time, I want only to speak to the thematic aspects.  To be precise, this is a story of first love and much of the book focuses on the evolution of the relationship between Samantha and Jase.  So, if you're not into that sorta thing, check out now.  What the author has chosen to do, and wisely IMO, is spend a huge portion of this book delving into the lives and psyches of these characters.  Certainly there are a few minor plot threads snuck in there, but the foundation is the fledgling love story.  It isn't until three-quarters of the way through the novel, and it's fairly long, that an tumultuous story arc emerges.  This sort of conflict is necessary, even in a simple love story, as it further defines and solidifies the relationships of this ensemble.<br /><br />There are obvious standouts in this book.  Sam and Jase, as I've mentioned, are two of my favorite characters of recent times.  But this book is rich with voices.  Tim, Nan's older brother, is a wonderfully hysterical addition and brings with him both drama and levity.  The Garretts, yup the whole family, are fantastic.  Each has an individual voice and the little ones are so charming and funny, one can't help but love them.  This is yet another area in which Huntley Fitzpatrick shines.  The characters she creates are unique and engaging and realistic, it's almost like being up on Samantha's roof (where she sat and watched life happen without her for so long) with her.  Not once, during the entire read did I confuse a single one of the Garrett's eight children.  Bloody brilliant.  Grace, Sam's mom, and Clay, Grace's political aide, are also wonderfully crafted and exceptionally executed.  Every line Clay uttered, ever slimy, selfserving remark was perfectly placed and demonstrative of his contempt and malefeasance.<br /><br />Now, onto the stuff that hacked off half a star.  There were times, though only a few, during which I felt Jase's reactions to events/situations seemed a bit too mature and evolved for his seventeen years.  Though these were few and far betweem, they were during moments when a freak out would have been totally expected and reasonable.  I just don't see a teenage boy reacting so indifferent.  It's a niggling little issue, but one which plays a major part in the storytelling so it matters.<br /><br />But, regardless of this slight bump, it's a book I strongly recommend with one little caveat.  This novel is teeming with expletives and there's a rather tasteful but explicit sex scene (and I mean explicit by Y/A standards, not adult).  So I'd suggest the sixteen and older sect.;1353119656000;Near Perfection;AFTXMOF65QENKQLJVME63GEUXJGQ;False

I squealed like a sea lion when I saw the gorgeous cover on my kindle. Not pretty but let's get back to the point of this review.<br /><br />I absolutely adore the fact that there are many themes that I love recurring within the book 'step-brother', 'brothers best friend' and 'friends to lovers' all included within it.

The majority part of the book goes back and forth between the two main characters and shows glimpses of each other living their lives with and without each other with heartbreak and a constant battle with conflict.<br /><br />It isn't until the 70% mark when my attention was at full peak and the whole story seems to get completely enthralling. The drama is heightened,  and the chemistry and lust between the two is much more steamier and panty-soaking worthy.<br />I liked Kira throughout the book but it wasn't until this point that I LOVED her. I was Team Kira the whole way.<br /><br />Of course when the time came, I got my imaginary pom-poms out to root for Brayden and Kira. The ending was perfect because I didn't see it coming.

Except for Kane of course but I'll get to him later. The Sons of Wrath reminded me of J.R. Ward's best-selling Black Dagger Brotherhood series and well, need I say more? Replace a house full of sexy vamps with one full of beefy demons and you have my full attention! Soul Avenged is not for the faint of heart with its gruesome battles and stone cold heroine; heck, even the love story is dark!<br /><br />Readers get to enjoy multiple POVs which is always fun. There's nothing better than getting to experience both sides of a story. Rather than having to guess at the various characters' motivations we get to witness them first-hand. I love visiting the minds of twisted individuals and this book has plenty to choose from! That being said, I found the background info to be lacking. The world felt post-apocalyptic and yet not. The outskirts of town are littered with abandoned buildings and mangled corpses but no one seems to notice. People don't know that lycans exist yet they avoid these ""bad parts"" of the city like the plague. There's a link missing somewhere in there...<br /><br />The Sons of Wrath were by far the best part of this novel and I wish that they'd gotten more face-time but seeing how this series is named after these hunky demons I expect that this won't be the last we'll see of them. There's an interesting mix of preternaturals in this story too and they're not the usual suspects either; I'm talking ghouls and hellhounds people! And finally, just when I thought that I'd read every possible variation on werewolves Lake proved me wrong. I enjoyed the changeling aspect of her lore as well as their violent natures. This book truly is a rabid read!<br /><br />Ayden's character was a little too black-and-white for me. I enjoyed her spunk and killer battle instincts but found that her human side was lacking. Other than the odd blip she seems incapable of feeling anything other than hatred which isn't surprising given her lack of memories but she was still too much of a Debbie Downer for my tastes. Kane is the complete opposite; his wisecracks and charm added some much needed sunshine to this otherwise gloomy tale.<br /><br />Soul Avenged is gory and dark with endless action that's sure to please even the manliest of Urban Fantasy readers.

Two days later I'd bought and finished reading the entire book.<br /><br />As a mystery, this story is quite good. I suspected who the real killer was quite early on but wouldn't have bet on it at all. Finding out whodunnit in the end didn't come as a complete shock as just enough clues were shared with the reader throughout. However, the journey to finding out who-all-might-have-done-it revealed several twists and surprises not expected.<br /><br />The thing that ups this story to a 5 star rather than just 4 or 4.5 for me is the story of Dan and his relationships with everyone - himself, his father, his brother, his wife, the locals in the town he grew up in and on and on. Here is a man who has to find himself but doesn't set out on any extraordinary existentialist or spiritual journey to do so. In fact, he's fairly certain he already knows what's what. However as the story unfolds, he finds himself without that ever really becoming the focus of the book or taking away from the main plot. And thank goodness too because sometimes his quick temper and family pride is really foolish (but understandable).<br /><br />I also love the various secondary characters who are exceptionally well developed. By the end, you kind of feel you know this town.<br /><br />Finally, I loved the way the author reveals the multi-faceted nature of the locals' hostility towards progress. (POTENTIAL SPOILER) Apart from the usual 'Those McMansions will spoil the tranquility of our quaint little town', we also discover several fears - as it stands, everyone in town is relatively poor, power structures have been established and re-inforced over generations; 'everyone' is happy like this. But when the development and new money comes in, the locals fear that their tattered and patched possessions and homes will suddenly not be good enough, their children will hope for more and want to leave, certain villagers will benefit more and the power structure might shift etc.<br /><br />This isn't a fluffy book- irreversably bad things will happen to good people.

184154342X;2;184154342X;3.0;"Passionate by this time period, the author tried to bring the world of the Vikings and western early medieval period to the Warhammer Ancient Battles rule set. At first sight this could lead to boring battles, since many armies shared some similar characteristics and fighting concepts, but in this aspect the author managed to differentiate them a lot pointing their most unique characteristics and working to make them visible on the battlefield and their tactics. You will also find chronological tables and an historical resume of each kingdom. There are some maps, a fabulous cover illustration by the renowned military artist Giuseppe Rava, adequate internal art by Jonny Hodgson and beautiful color photos representing units, the battles of Clontarf and Hastings, architecture (including a motte and bailey castle).<br /><br />Several special rules are introduced or reprinted so that you can bring to life some aspects essential to represent a battle or a skirmish in the time period and geographical location covered by this rules set (800AD – 1100AD), including Werod (fanatical loyalty to the chieftain), Fury of the Norseman (low leadership troops fear Vikings), Shieldwall, etc.<br /><br />The campaign rules are fine, although not fabulous. But some of the new scenarios are very interesting. There are also skirmish rules to fight for some small objective that will give a bonus to the battles or campaign such as the relics of a saint.<br /><br />To represent family heirlooms or items of famous smiths, there are special weapons and armors…although far less mighty than the ones found in Warhammer fantasy, they provide a nice feel to the psyche of those Norse warriors.<br /><br />You will find the following lists: Armies of the Norseman (Denmark, Norway, Hiberno-Norse, Orkneyinga, Kingdom of the isles), Armies of the English (Saxon armies of Wessex, Mercia, Anglia, Northumbria, Kent, Sussex), Armies of Caledonia (Dal Riata, Picts, Strathclyde, Alba and Scotland), Armies of the Welsh (Gwynedd, Powys, Dumnonia, the southern kingdoms - Dyfed, Gwent, Glamorgan, etc), Armies of Hibernia - Ireland (Connaught, Munster, Ulster, Leinster), Armies of the Western Franks (Carolingian French, County of Flanders, Duchy of Normandy, Capetian French, Bretons). In the lists you’ll find most types of troops that were characteristic of those kingdoms, but you’ll also be able to pick semi-mythical troops such as Ulfhednar or the Jomsvikings.<br /><br />It also includes mercenary lists where some units can be hired by some employers (each army have their pick). The strategy tips for each army are very useful and the painting and collecting units to form your army are good although slightly dated.<br /><br />Unfortunately there are no special characters. There are many incredibly interesting character that could be included and would lead to less constraints in the army lists to try to represent those remarkable persons by the basic characters in the lists (leading to base Leadership 10 to ALL Viking Konnungr for example and other non-sense like that).<br /><br />Like in all army lists in every game, it’s impossible to please everybody regarding the values of each and every troop type. So I usually don’t comment that fact, but I believe that the author made some huge blunders. For example and expanding the last paragraph: The Viking Konnungr have leadership 10, but the French Carolingian King have only 9! So Charlemagne will be a worse battle leader than any Viking king. That issue also happens with the Saxons (poor Alfred the great) or the Hibernian (Brian Boru doesn’t approve of leadership 10 for Viking kings; he will search the author in the afterlife to have a little chat with him).<br /><br />There are many issues like the above mentioned, I’ll provide some illustrative examples: Hyrdman with 4 Toughness so it reflects the Shieldwall tactical formation in defense , ok that’s acceptable; but why does Huscarls have simultaneously the Shieldwall rule and Toughness 4?<br /><br /> Angles can’t be led by Cyning, but those Angles have a rule that states that their Ealdormen are affected by the Hatred rule to anyone killing their Cyning!<br /><br />Why can we buy special equipment to berserkers, such as throwing spears, if they attack like the “goblin fanatics” with a specified damage and randomized number of hits and then they are removed as casualties?<br /><br />All in all, this is a fine supplement to this series of books that provide detailed rules for fascinating battle engagements. It isn’t advised to use the armies contained in this rules with other armies from other specific time periods (such as battling the armies of Flavius Aetius with your Welsh army).";1426782863000;The Vikings are approaching, form the shieldwall!;AEJN2JYZAGD4P6ARV3YQJ55KSDVA;False

What IS clear is his attempt to create the literary equivalent of a ""bottle"" story -- locale limited to the crime scene and the lab, few other meaningful settings, and those, I think, only at the very end -- and show Our Heroes in a scientific Race Against the Clock.<br /><br />The drawback is twofold: First, there's not all that much at stake. There's a professional assassin unable to get away from a mountaintop locale, and if Our Guys don't solve the mystery of who's responsible for what in a ""hail of bullets"" crime scene at a nearby stakeout site, he'll get away. Not get away to do something bad like kill an innocent or deliver a bio-hazard into ""the wrong hands,"" just get away. Second: There's very little human drama, and it's the balance of shattered lives against the technical road to justice that has always been the trick to a CSI mystery -- to say nothing of those cameo, yet cumulative glimpses into the humanity of the CSIs themselves.<br /><br />Goddard does seem to have a handle on the regular characters in terms of attitude and tone ... but for the most part they lack depth outside of their scientific curiosity; and this is made manifest in the long technical and expository speeches he gives them to rattle off -- often peppered with internal sidebars, like this one, set off by dashes -- that keep ironically violating the verisimilitude he's trying so hard to maintain; because for all his veteran CSI knowhow (Goddard was one in real life), real people, even real science people, simply don't talk that way. Even allowing for the inevitable neatening process of art, that gives fictional characters the ability to be unusually articulate and concise, Mr. Goddard way overindulges the literary license.<br /><br />It's not a horrible book, and if you like the CSI universe enough, perhaps not even a dull one ... but it makes you miss the (seeming) ease with which Max Allan Collins managed to walk the tightrope with all his previous CSI novels ... and makes you appreciate his openness in acknowledging Matthew V. Clemens as his researcher and co-plotter. I can't imagine a more difficult TV series to wrangle into satisfying tie-in novels, because the template is SO restrictive ... and reading Ken Goddard's noble but labored misfire puts into perspective just how artful the Collins books are, and how deceptive their easy flow.";1196333460000;Makes You Appreciate the Ones That Look Easy ...;AFGSJQ3RD6GKLQRT4KNFSFK5JDKQ;True

It ought to be the equivalent in literature of those faded, dried flowers that used to be found pressed between the pages of the old family bible. Instead it is redolent of freshly cut flowers still carrying a sprinkling of morning dew.<br />The freshness and the perfection of form are certainly astonishing. Jane Austin is as good as story teller as ever picked up a pen, knowing exactly how to construct plots, and what incidents and dialogues to detail in full and what to briefly summarize. Her ""world"" is small but intricately constructed. Every characteristic, quality and idea has a precise and fixed value, all being ranked strictly and sternly according to decorum, logic and morality.<br />Despite its architectural perfection, however, a recent re-reading reveals one or two construction features that are questionable. How could it be, for example that Fitzwilliam Darcy could have such a dragon for an aunt? I also wonder about the friendship between Darcy and Bingley. How did it begin? It is obviously important to each, but we are given nothing of its history.<br />Jane Austen lived long enough to see this book published and enjoyed amongst her own family and a small readership. Her mother entertained family members with it, reading it, in Jane Austen's estimation, a little too quickly. Distinguished British actress Lindsay Duncan reads it with perfect timing and inflexion in this highly recommended audio tape format, which presents the novel in an unabridged version of just over twelve hours.";1038165471000;The freshness and perfection of form are astonishing.;AE4H4OJCE72PRQAR5EY5RBLVNYSQ;False

0679732497;0;0679732497;5.0;"I found this novel by way of ""No Beast So Fierce,"" a classic and brutal crime novel that gave me an itch for similar works. ""Pop. 1280"" is significantly different from ""Beast"" and other crime novels in a number of ways. For one thing the protagonist is a sheriff, although he's as despicable or even more so than your average anti-hero ex-con. At the same time, there are numerous threads in his complex character that a reader can not only relate to, but admire.<br /><br />This kind of complexity is what makes criminal protagonists so effective. It's like they keep daring us to go along with them, the way Iago directs his soliloquies at the viewer throughout ""Othello."" Like the Shakespearean villain, we're never quite sure what the sheriff's aims are. Better yet, neither does he, which makes the novel even more comic.<br /><br />Once the plot starts moving—within the first few pages, thanks to Thompson's expert plotting and dialogue—we begin to see the novel's themes take shape. I'd be happy as a clam with a conniving sheriff manipulating his way throughout his podunk town, but there's much more going on in ""Pop. 1280"" that merits attention. From race to law enforcement to electioneering, Thompson paints a picture of a hellish small town that unnervingly reflects America in its present day. The author dug deep to paint his portrait of a populous overly-willing to give in to baser instincts, and it's resonated all the way from publication to the present day.<br /><br />Yet it never feels weighty, or preachy. Thompson does what a crime novelist does best: He portrays the dark reality of society while playing with its norms and laws. It's a tougher balance still to strike when you make your main character a LEO, but here it only heightens the humor and suspense. This is an edge-of-your seat read through and through, that will also make you laugh your ass off, then immediately fill you with a sense of guilt just for laughing.<br /><br />One criticism: I didn't care for the ending. I didn't care for ""No Beast So Fierce""'s ending either, so perhaps it's a feature of excellent and unique crime novels to sort of skid to their conclusion. In any case, I felt both conclusions could be better, yet they're not so bad that you throw the book (or kindle) across the room. Perhaps it's a sign of a great read that you're left wanting more...But still. The finale could have been a bit bigger.<br /><br />Otherwise, highly recommended. I'm very glad this book hasn't faded to obscurity, because it belongs on the shelf of anyone who enjoys this particular genre. It's simply one of the finest dime novels I've ever read, even if I paid $5.99 to read it.";1611799366683;Uniquely HIlarious & Disturbing;AG4HT5BAJVCHDR7OE4DDFVZP5MFA;False

0440418321;8;0440418321;5.0;"[SPOILER ALERT... review is for the series]<br /><br />The use of the word, and spelling, ""Daemon"" is from the original Celtic word (pronounced ""DAY-mon"") that means ""guardian"" or ""watcher"".  The ""Daemons"" in these stories represent the soul and/or conscience of the person.  (In one of the other books of the series, she comes into our world and is shocked that we carry our ""daemons"" inside of us.)  The evil that others are attempting to do is to separate the person from their daemon (soul) and render both the daemon and its person emotionless and powerless to know wrong from right.  The symbolism of this is powerful!<br /><br />Reviewer J. Whelan:  you're right that Lyra is aware of her power and aristocracy, but through the whole journey, she learns the responsibility of her position, talents, and intelligence.  She also learns that some of the best people are the most humble and simple and some of the most evil are the mighty and proud.  As her values change, so do her intentions.<br /><br />One of the most challenging things about the series is that it sometimes seems so clear cut who is good and who is evil, but as the story progresses good and evil are blurred on the least likely characters.<br /><br />It's a challenging series that makes you think.  If you are religious, the last book might make you think about how your God sounds to others who don't share your beliefs.  If you remember that none of the questions or challenges change who God is, you might see how religion looks from the outside.";1169249173000;A challenging, compelling story, easily misinterpreted;AEQBDS3OEICAQ4ZDHVVTWLCC5J4Q;False

0061558265;4;0061558265;3.0;Vampires have taken over the globe. The internet and cell phones are outlawed. Nuclear bombs are disarmed. The air is extremely polluted, shrinking daylight hours to only a couple each day. People with desirable blood types are put into farms to be bred or bled. Humanity keeps going as it always has, getting used to their vampire overlords' demands. Ephraim Goodweather is broken. His wife has been turned into a vampire and she frequently stalks and torments him. His son is missing and he has no idea if he's alive, or dead, or a vampire. In addition to all this, he has turned to drugs and alcohol to dull his feelings and survive day to day. He and his small group of friends are the only hope that human race has left to save themselves. They plan to find the Master's place of origin and nuke it, destroying him and all of his offspring. Can Ephraim hold it together long enough to destroy his mortal enemy or will he simply drown in his own sorrow?<br /><br />The Night Eternal is the third and final book in the Strain trilogy. I loved both of the previous books and had high expectations for this one. I was a little disappointed, but many great things continued from the previous books. As always, the characters are completely fleshed out and multidimenstional. Ephraim is a good person, but became irresponsible and self indulgent due to his family and his world being completely torn apart. Nora is struggling to hide her less than lucid, aged mother from the new society that views the elderly as a drain of resources. Fez is trying to find a working nuclear bomb on his worldly travels and developing a relationship with Nora while Ephraim continues to drown his sorrows. The most compelling character to me is Mr. Quinlan, the only born vampire in existence. He was born during the reign of Caligula and his only goal is to destroy the Master, which would result in his death. His back story is fascinating and his enigmatic presence in the earlier books becomes more understandable. The other triumph of this book is the action sequences and sustaining a high level of suspense throughout. Their adventures take them from blood farms to the houses of the rich to the bowels of abandoned universities to a dark, ominous island.<br /><br />The Night Eternal lost me when it broke from the other books and maintained a distinctly fantasy and mythology based origin for the vampires and relied on ridiculous moments of deus ex machina to solve their problems. I loved that the first two books had detailed, scientific explanations for vampire biology and behavior that the main characters figured out in order to defeat them. It was fascinating and something I had never seen before in vampire novels. This new, magic material just shatters the past science fiction basis. There are fallen angels, prophecies galore, and at least a few instances of deus ex machina, which is one of the worst writing tropes. It cheapened the story for me and was just annoying. I was disappointed that a great science fiction series suddenly changed into a mediocre fantasy.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed The Night Eternal if I ignored the ridiculous prophecies and magical nonsense. The writing remained excellent beyond that and the characters stayed true to themselves. I would recommend that fans of this series ascertain if they can tolerate the change in tone before reading.;1321901419000;A great science fiction series suddenly turns into a mediocre fantasy;AH266LCHBWG45QH4R45WDKSNCVBQ;False

0307984702;6;0307984702;5.0;As a reader who has always been awed by the mysteries surrounding the Titanic, I really wanted to find another book that would teach me something new that I had not read before.  This terrific insight into the lives of the first class passengers brought me exactly what I wanted.<br /><br />Throughout the duration of the book, the author would focus on one of the passengers and let the reader know what they would or could have been doing during any time of the voyage.  I felt that I became close with each one and truly cared about their experiences.  Some of the people mentioned I did not know had died and the whole tragedy hit me in a new way when a person that I felt I was on the journey with did not survive.<br /><br />The back story of Archie Butt was one of the most interesting due to his political connections with both Presidents Teddy Roosevelt and Taft.  Lady Duff Gordon's story showed me that she was more than just a mere fashion designer.  I also even have more respect than before for Margaret Brown.<br /><br />Many books about Titanic focus solely on the class distribution and how so many of the people who died were third class passengers.  This book shows that everyone was in danger due to the lack of knowledge about what was really happening.  Most honestly did not fathom the idea of the Titanic sinking.  Including the crew, a female of any class had a chance of survival at roughly 75%.  A male of any class had a chance of survival at roughly 20%.  Many believe today that first class passengers did not have much of a chance of dying on the Titanic.  Especially in the case of first class men (where only one in three survived), this is not entirely the case.  This book really shows how the passengers just did not know what was going on.<br /><br />I do have one critique about the author's obsession with the supposed homosexuality of some of the passengers.  I know in today's world, we find that element to add sensation to a story but I do not see why it is relevant.  I want to know about these people's lives in a factual manner.  I do not care to hear about whether they may or may not have been homosexual when they are not here to speak of it themselves.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for a different view of one of the most famous voyages in history.;1371702167000;A Different View;AEILLOSRTFL2QA4FMMY2XWWOUYIA;True

0316427268;0;0316427268;5.0;I love this book. It opened my eyes to an essential inequality that is all around us in the U.S.<br /><br />The author (Priya Fielding-Singh) takes us on a journey to understand what's going on for families - especially mothers - of different income levels as they make choices about food and feed their kids. You get to know the moms and understand why they do the things they do.<br /><br />It's nonfiction, but I found myself thoroughly engrossed, turning page after page to find out what would happen. One thing I'd never thought about before was how kids' pickiness can lead to such different outcomes for families without the means to provide a second option if their kid doesn't like Option A. How many vegetables have I thrown away because my kids wouldn't eat them? How many times have I let my my kids make something else if they didn't like what I'd made for dinner? Without extra money, how many times would I just give them pizza and fries because I'd know they'd eat it?  Probably a lot of times.<br /><br />I really like how the book makes clear the love that all the moms have for their kids and their desire to do the best for them - and how all of the moms had so much in common. Reading this book expanded my heart and made me feel more connected to humanity.  I highly recommend it.;1637185142386;Will open your eyes and heart;AHMAXXD37XZ4Q4FCPJMHBEW6FKRQ;False

094886429X;2;094886429X;5.0;"This is an excellent study of the campaign and battle of June 1666 – ‘the greatest battle in the Age of Sail’, fought between the Royal Navy and the United Provinces during the Second Anglo-Dutch War. The book is told primarily from the English view, due to the nature of the sources, but the activities of the Dutch, French and Danes are adequately covered, and the narrative is not biased.<br /><br />The Contents are:<br />P001: The Generals<br />P015: The Royal Navy<br />P036: The Ships<br />P051: Guns, Flags, and the River Thames<br />P066: Preparations<br />P083: Lowestoft<br />P102: The Indian Prize<br />P120: The Other Side of the Hill<br />P136: The Division of the Fleet<br />P153: Rupert’s Expedition<br />P168: The French<br />P182: The Morning of the First of June<br />P198: The First Day<br />P219: The Second Day<br />P236: The Third Day<br />P251: The Fourth Day<br />P271: The Aftermath<br />P287: The Sequel<br />P304: Epilogue<br />P313: Appendices A – M<br />P363: Notes<br />P387: Sources<br />P392-404: Index<br /><br />There are 32 pages of illustrations, and many excellent tactical maps, and the endpapers have a map of the battle area, with the various days’ positions marked, and excellent details of the shoals and banks which defined the area involved.<br /><br />The book is well laid out in structure, the opening chapters introducing the main (English) characters, the ships and their outfitting and the development of tactics from the previous war. The first major battle of the war in 1665 was at Lowestoft, followed by an attempt to seize the Dutch merchant fleets sheltering in Denmark – with the connivance of the Danish king, who neglected to inform his subordinates of his treachery, and so foiled his own plans. Then there is a study of the Dutch fleet, followed by the English strategic decision to divide the fleet in the face of French intervention and a possible invasion of Ireland, leading to an under-strength fleet being left to face the Dutch. The battle is described day-by-day in great detail, with excellent and informative maps of the fleet manoeuvres. Rupert’s division returned just in time to save the English from disaster on the third day, but eventually numbers tell, and the Dutch manage to win the day on the final day of the battle. Despite being severely outnumbered in ships, the tactics and greater firepower of the Royal Navy managed to keep the battle going for four days, and there were several occasions during the battle when a victory for both sides was feasible. We also see the ‘breaking of the line’ achieved several times, by both sides, and we see demonstrated successes that in later line-breaking sea fights could only be dreamed of by the victors.<br /><br />This is a well-written and readable account, though it desperately needs a Glossary for those who are not familiar with the terminology of sailing warfare; you can still follow the action quite easily, but it would not have been difficult to provide one. The author spent twelve years studying the original sources, and the wealth of detail is superb. This is an essential book for anyone interested in the age of fighting sail.<br /><br />Further reading:<br />[[ASIN:094886429X A Distant Storm: The Four Days' Battle of 1666]] – the first edition of this book, profusely illustrated in colour.<br />[[ASIN:0851771661 Great Ships: The Battle Fleet of King Charles II]]<br />[[ASIN:0582056306 The Anglo-Dutch Wars of the Seventeenth Century (Modern Wars In Perspective)]]<br /><br />In the second edition, there are 32 pages of illustrations, and many excellent tactical maps, and the endpapers have a map of the battle area, with the various days’ positions marked, and excellent details of the shoals and banks which defined the area involved.

Every year we surround ourselves with whimsy and a bit of fear to come together for one night in an attempt to scare each other. Some of us, we spend the night helping our little ones trick or treat, and we take into consideration that there are monsters, but dammit they aren’t coming near my kids.<br /><br />Yeah, I’m that mom that carries pepper spray when I take my kids to Trick or Treat, and my son thinks it’s a seasoning, but I digress. The point is, Halloween is a different thing to different people, and we all can connect on some level to the feelings of fear.<br /><br />Fear is something that is different for different people.

Kirkham’s “Depths of Darkness” part of the Saints & Sinners series.<br /><br />Opinion<br />Full disclosure here guys, first, I talk to Crystal on Twitter a whole lot. And second, I got to review an ARC copy of this book, so my copy may have been different from the one you have. But, that in mind, I only was given this copy to review on the agreement she let me review this with “Brutal” honesty. So for her sake, I shall do my best to be brutal.<br /><br />With that in mind, we shall change things up and start with the critiques! I will put in all the good stuff after, don’t worry.<br /><br />Critique number one because I know others are going to see it, let’s address the elephant in the room.  It is very unusual to have a prequel as a sequel, especially when the hooks are different and the path that is taken is backwards. The first book “Road to Redemption” had a hook that grabbed you and lasted a chapter, but wasn’t exactly the end all and be all to the rest of the book. “Depths of Darkness” has a seamless hook that haunts you and makes you want to hug a box of tissues for a month. It chilled me to the bone, and that chill lasted with me to the end of the book. I’m not sure if it was good exactly, but it really did hook me in.<br /><br />Critique number two, I’m not a big fan of child murders, and this book has mention of them. I am not comfortable with it. I have kids of my own, the idea of children suffering needlessly hurting or dying, it is not something I can stomach very easily. But, the murders are essential to the plot in this book, and it’s in the synopsis, so no spoilers if you read the synopsis.<br /><br />Critique number three, and this one is probably my biggest critique; I don’t have anything to critique on story structure, grammar or spelling, because I didn’t find anything. I tried too, but again, I have an ARC copy so if you guys see something I missed, feel free to let me know in the comments. It is possible we have different copies but I do know Crystal had worked to ensure mine was the as close to the final product as possible.<br /><br />Now, with the brutality out of the way to let’s jump into this. Our story is a detective story which is very different, but of the same world and with some of the same characters from Crystal’s last “Saints and Sinners’ novel. In this one there is a set of murders, and it’s up to a former detective to trust someone he isn’t sure he can trust, to help him solve and stop this.<br /><br />If you are familiar with Crystal’s previous work, you are probably aware already there are a lot of demons in this. No spoilers, but my favorite characters from the last book are back, specifically Ruby. Ruby is one of the most amazing characters that I have seen because she’s versatile and has a lot of depth. She fit in so well in the last story in two different ways, but in this story, she’s more personable in my opinion than last time.<br /><br />To add to the richness of the story is a character arch involving Iain and how he becomes who he was meant to be. Anyone who is a skeptic I think can get behind this character to enjoy the world that is painted around him through pain and misery. The dynamic between both characters is something akin to a “Sam and Dianne” thing, only if you take that, add some Red Bull and Vodka and then kick it off a bridge to bungee jump. The tension between the two is fun, but in my opinion, this is not overplayed at all.<br /><br />In the end though, the book goes into an interesting place, that I felt was played out well by the first book. That goes to my first critique. Yeah, for a sequel, this is a prequel. That was intended, and the idea is to make you think. You know what’s going to happen to Ruby eventually, but you also have to know why it happened at all. You know what will become of many things at some point, but without knowing where this started, how can you know the way it ends?<br /><br />I like what Crystal did here. Some may argue that it is a big jarring to have one book end one way and another book ends where the first one starts. I disagree. I think the point of this is to get us all to a full understanding of what is happening overall. By having it spaced in such a manner, we will have a rewarding experience later. I like that there is a delayed gratification to the way Crystal is laying these books out, it comes across to me as more enjoyable, but I can see someone disagreeing with my personal opinion here.<br /><br />To which my other point is in my opinion, this book is fine as a standalone book, and having a timeline does not help this series. You do not have to read the other one to understand what is happening here, and vice versa. It helps to do both, it probably is better to read this novel first than the first novel second, but it's by no means required nor necessary.  I am certain that anyone could have a heck of a good time reading this series in any order, and that to me is a testament of encapsulated stories in an overall story arch. That’s a rare talent to be sure, even movies have a difficult time accomplishing such a feat.<br /><br />And to my second critique from above, well was comfort level. This was a rough read for me when it came to dark themes, because it really struck to some of my emotions. This was frightening to me in a way the other book was not, and it had a lot of tough spots that made me stop and actually cry. I have a tender soul I think, and that is just me. Unlike some of the other books I’ve read, or even the first one in the series, this was a bit darker in tone in places. So, if you are into that kind of thing, I hope you enjoy this. If you are however like me, this might be bumpy at spots.<br /><br />What Crystal however nailed and I think should explore further, was the detective dynamic. I love mystery and detective stories. I love the classic “who dun it?” type of books. This good cop bad cop thing that was between Ian and Ruby should in my opinion, be more of a thing. I honestly wanted a triple scoop of that. Adding onto it one of my other favorite characters Father Brannigan, and it’s a match made in heaven. These spots was where I got very into the book, and felt so much about where the story was going. The other parts though, those were tough.<br /><br />To my last point, the pacing is excellent in this story, the book reads more relaxed than the first did to me, and as I said I didn’t find anything out of place. There wasn’t grammar errors that I found in her previous book, nor spelling issues. I enjoyed this book, even if it did scare me to my socks.<br /><br />Score<br />For scoring, I’m going to go with my traditional methods here and score right down the middle as honestly as possible. I’m giving “Depths of Darkness” a 91/100. Despite any critique I gave, it’s really good.  I recommend this to anyone who is into darker themed books, and wants a bit of fear with their Halloween. If that is for you, get a copy!";1540299450508;The only thing we have to fear is ...?;AGOEOYR6VFCBVXZ6ADIRBI3YTCXA;False

I wasn't a huge fan of her first book, but I was curious to see what she would present as her &#34;master class.&#34;  There are some diagrams of her method of folding things and she tries to find a way to include boring but necessary items in her system, but it's mostly more of the same.  Here is a sample: she advocates getting rid of even boring things that don't spark joy, which is okay because you can always find a substitute (driving nails with a frying pan is an example). She admits this doesn't always work, though.  Her example? Trying to tighten a screwdriver with a ruler, but breaking the ruler and crying because it was her favorite one. If you don't immediately think, as i did, &#34;who would ever think of using a ruler to tighten a screw when every house has at least a table knife?&#34; or wonder at a person who would have ruler they liked well enough to cry over,  you will probably like it much more than I did, plus I just can't get over her desire to toss all paper and books and her habit of talking to inanimate objects.

She lands in Panama hoping to find work as a crew member to cross through the Panama Canal on her way to backpack through South America.

After being welcomed into the crew of the Eik, Lila hits it off with Eivind, but tries to deny her feelings at every turn. Once landing in on the other side of the canal, Lila must make the tough decision of whether to follow her plans or follow her heart.<br /><br />This was a wonderful debut novel! The setting is absolutely serene. You can feel it through the pages - the jungle, the sun and humidity and the sounds. It is escapist fun and just the story I needed to read right now. I am a huge fan of Below Deck, so I was fascinated by the inner workings of the yacht. There are parts that may get a little technical for some that don't know boats, but I really enjoyed learning how things work. You can tell that Alden has spent significant time sailing and knows her stuff.<br /><br />My favorite part of the book was the cast of characters. They come from all over the world and their backgrounds are incredibly diverse. I loved seeing how the yachting community is like a family. They help each other out with question, acting with love and not out of obligation. Edith and Peter are hilarious and they made me smile.<br /><br />Eivind was a wonderful hero. He was suave, incredibly flirty, and oh so adorable. He was persistent in his attraction to Lila and never let her forget that he wanted her and was into her. He was all about chasing Lila and showing her the world. And the open mic night performance...LOVED. My only wish for Eivind was to dive a tad deeper into his background, especially how he gave up being a chemist to sail the world and chose not to look back. I wanted to know more of why he was complacent working in a restaurant, instead of using his degree.<br /><br />I am excited to read the next book in this series!;1617118226456;Take Me Away!;AE2ZDLFSTLFV4QVGOYBLG2BQNUNA;False

B00H5562YQ;5;B00H5562YQ;4.0;"There are so many books waiting to be read on my Kindle (or on my to-read list) that I don't pay much attention to the freebies offered through a number of services like BookBub.com, but for some strange reason, this one got my attention back on Feb. 24, 2014. It had enough 5- and 4-star reviews at Amazon.com that I figured the author - once CEO of a General Motors Corp. division - couldn't have that many friends willing to boost the ratings whether or not it was any good. Since the book description was interesting as well, I decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />For the most part, I'm glad I did. I finished it in a few days with limited time available to read, and by the time I was done, I found it had accumulated 102 reviews at Amazon, 93 of them 4 stars or higher - so I'm pretty sure my 4-star rating is on target.<br /><br />The book skillfully brings together high technology (in the form of artificial intelligence) and low (people still get killed by strangling, bullets and swimming with fishes), and more than once the late Mario Puzo's &lt;i>Godfather&lt;/i> series came to mind. At the start, a Mafia-style guy named Alex Nicholas is murdered, leaving as his next-of-kin a third wife of questionable morals and a financial corporation CEO and straight-arrow brother Michael, who takes on the responsibility of settling Alex's affairs. Things get murky when Michael is contacted by his &#34;deceased&#34; brother via a computer software program as yet unknown by the rest of the world.<br /><br />Slowly, Michael becomes absorbed in the shady world Alex knew (another nod to &#34;The Godfather&#34; as expressed in Part III by Michael Corleone: &#34;Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in.&#34;) And slowly, just as did Corleone, Michael Nicholas begins to enjoy the power of running a high-stakes business and the danger that comes with it.<br /><br />But if Alex is really dead, how is he able to communicate so effectively with his brother? After all, IBM's Watson was able to beat two very intelligent former winning contestants on &#34;Jeopardy!&#34; rather handily, but being able to make meaningful conversation with a human being and have a pretty good handle on what the future holds goes beyond anything that's known to man at this point - as far as anyone knows.<br /><br />The book ends a bit abruptly and with no real resolution to how Alex has pulled all that off nor an answer to the question of the physical safety of Michael and his beautiful wife, Samantha. That was, no doubt, to ensure that everyone who bought this book will rush to get the next one, &#34;Death Logs In.&#34; I've seen nothing to indicate when that will be forthcoming, but I do know that if it takes very long I'll have forgotten what this one was all about - one of the pitfalls of those &#34;cliff-hanger&#34; kinds of novels (this one was published in December 2013). In comparison, every &#34;Godfather&#34; book left me wanting more, but each was an end unto itself.

In both an autocratic ruling class after a future worldwide disaster tries to create an insular community and hides the evidence that there is any world outside the dystopia they have created for reasons that are never very clear.  In this book it is the Church that controls every aspect of life and condemns to a living death any proof that there is an outside world.  While the scenario seems promising at the beginning, scene after scene of zombie attacks and narrow escapes become quite tiresome.  The protagonist, with her twin obsessions of finding the ocean and pursuing her fiance's brother, quickly becomes tiresome as well.

The Fateful Lightning picks up Sherman's march immediately after the sacking of Atlanta and follows his army through Georgia and the Carolinas.<br /><br />There is little middle ground in the world of Civil War analysis regarding Sherman. The general is either hated as savage and brutal or respected as the finest battlefield commander of the war.  The Fateful Lightning, through Shaara's use of the historical novel, brings a semblance  of balance to the Sherman legacy. Shaara's  research is excellent.<br /><br />Like all of Shaara's  writing, using the vehicle of the novel, the key players are humanized. The genre also allows for the creation of fictional characters to flush out the story line. In this case a young slave, freed by Sherman's march is among the thousands of  former slaves who follow<br /><br />Sherman's army of liberation as it heads north, taking them away from their masters and plantations.

He was dragged there by his mother who is one of David Koresh's many wives. Cyrus doesn't believe any of Koresh's teachings but he doesn't think Koresh is a bad guy, just a bit out there. Well, everything Cyrus thought he knew changes when the FBI storms the church and begins attacking and killing everyone he loves. It's not long before Koresh's teachings seem to be confirmed through the actions of the FBI.<br /><br />This book takes the Waco incident and turns it on its head, asking &#34;What would it have looked like if David Koresh had actually been right?&#34; The answer: crazy, just like him! The novel opens with a bang and just keeps going from there. It is a real ride, never letting up for even a second.<br /><br />Aside from the break-neck pace, Jerry Gordon makes some strong points about the actual event, implying that the FBI should have handled the situation a bit differently. They were after Koresh but wound up killing over 80 others in the process, most of whom were weak minds following what they were taught, as well as their children. It truly was a massacre.<br /><br />Overall, I found Breaking the World by Jerry Gordon to be a fascinating and entertaining read. I recommend it to fans of apocalyptic stories and anyone interested in cults.";1525880903106;"A fast-paced and sympathetic look at the Waco, Texas standoff that asks ""What if?""";AEZYUCFLZ5EL3LVKFMFXD2DITILQ;False

If you can't manage that, at least have some respect for yourself (to the author).  Your name is on the front cover and at some point an editor should have taken you aside and pointed out the irony of the assassination you were performing against your good name.  *Phew*...now that I've got that out, here's what I didn't like about the book.<br /><br />The protagonist, Ezio, never escapes his adolescent view of the world.  Sure, he goes from the privileged, devil-may-care, lifestyle of a rich bankers son to a celibate assassin, but his outlook on life never shifts to one of maturity.  The book pretends to be a coming of age story, where the son takes his father's mantle and continues a secret family tradition.  Instead, Ezio just comes across as an angry 13 year old.  He broods, he pouts, he lashes out at those who injured him...yawn.  Adding insult to injury is the way the author just 'gives it away'.  There is no suspense in this book...none.  On one page we find out that there is some new mystery Ezio must unravel and on the very next page, the secret is revealed with all the art and sophistication of a sledge hammer.  How in the heck do you take incredible ingredients like Renaissance Italy, secret societies from the Crusades, revenge, and love and write a book that stinks like the fart of a drunken Beagle?

0888395469;5;0888395469;4.0;"John Green is one of the alleged most authoritative names in bigfoot research and is classified as one of the Big 4 alongside Dahinden, Byrne, and Krantz. The ""Best of Sasquatch"" is the reprinting of Green's early books, ""On the Track of..."" and ""Encounters with..."" bigfoot/sasquatch. There is also an 'update' segment in the book to help bring it up to speed.<br /><br />It's great to see the books reprinted and the cover art for the book is well done. The update section is all too brief and Green spends little time or page space to give any really gripping information or update material, but this is standard with both of the books republished here also. Keep in mind, Green is a newspaperman by choice and trade, he's a 'bigfoot researcher' in his spare time. The books of course cover the classic stories of Ostman, Baumann, Ape Canyon, Patterson film, William Roe, and the Chapman's Ruby Creek. These are found in nearly all the books on the subject. The important thing here is that these are among the first real bigfoot/sasquatch based books sent into circulation so is actually some of the earliest printed tellings of the stories. Throughout the rest of the books are very brief encounters, incidents, sightings, etc.. that are convoluted and crammed together with little sense of flow or smoothness. It's like reading a newspaper that has a certain amount of space to stuff in as much info as they possibly can.<br /><br />The books are very quick reads and give a wide range of compacted stories. As for people calling John Green the authority on bigfoot research... collecting newspaper stories and dropping some money to go look at old tracks does not an expert make (but then what is a ""bigfoot expert"" anyway). Green has simply collected a massive amount of stories from a variety of sources, compiled them into his ""computerized database"", and then dropped enough of them together to form a few books. He offers no real theories on the creatures or makes any serious speculations, he's simply a newspaper guy that rounded up his favorite stories and put them into an order to form a book.<br /><br />But I digress... overall, very well done for being on the forefront of sasquatch material, it gave people a large scope on the range and variety of sightings/encounters. These books have probably been the most influential in the various books that have been published since.

He's grown since the first book but not by much. Which is good because people don't change overnight. Even when he's exasperating you still like him. He's like that friend who drives you crazy but you have their back no matter what.  The real life characters of Dr. Bell and Conan Doyle felt true to what I knew of the real people. It was fun to catch the hints of things to come with Doyle. All of this character development takes place within the story without being too much of a distraction. In some ways it felt a bit like a diversion to throw you off the murder mystery.  I really hope this series continues. I love the time period and the Edinburgh setting.

0786714328;9;0786714328;5.0;"Set in 1958 during Mardi Gras, Bourbon Street opens with Deke Watley, a nomadic gambler who has accepted an invitation to a high stakes Poker tournament sponsored by one of New Orleans's notorious residents, a blinded, aging gangster, August Moreau.  Carnival is in full swing - filling the streets with a myriad of bejeweled masked strangers. However, when Deke meets his fellow opponents, he realizes they are as equally eccentric.  Alex is August's angry, mulatto son from an island prostitute rumored to have dabbled in voodoo; Honey is the retired madam of one of the city's largest and most lucrative whorehouses; milquetoast Pritchett is August's lawyer and the keeper of secrets of all the dirty deeds; Pritchett's wife is a jealous whore-turned-housewife who has not changed her ways and finds pleasure in the backseats of cars along dark streets; and Hannah, a blonde bombshell, is August's young mistress and Deke's former love from a distant past.<br /><br />Although fairly short in length (169 pages), the suspense builds from the opening pages and accelerates as the plot thickens to involve all the above mentioned players (and others unnamed but equally enigmatic) to weave a tale of revenge, double-crossing, murder, and an unexpected finale (at least it was a surprise to me).  The characters are wonderfully broken and tormented - each nursing their wounds as best they can.  Gaiter's writing is strong as reflected in the vivid images he describes - I saw the atmospheric haze, I felt the heat, I heard the music, I inhaled the cigarette smoke, and I visualized the sweat dripping from the characters.  He added more realism by carefully interlacing the complexities of race relations and social inequalities of the day amid the decadent backdrop of the Big Easy.  I enjoyed the story and highly recommend it to those who might enjoy reading about this era and the suspense/crime genre.<br /><br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br /><br />APOOO BookClub<br /><br />Nubian Circle Book Club";1114037563000;Bravo!

0913165468;3;0913165468;5.0;I read this book when I was only 12 years old. I'm now 32 and have read all Robert McCammon's novels, several Stephen King novels (including The Stand), which this gets compared to very often, several Dean Koontz novels and all the short stories buy a certain racist writer of horror who I won't name. If you really know horror writers then you know who it is. After reading all these books by Stephen King, Robert McCammon, Dean Koontz (and the other horror writer I won't name), I must say that Swan Song is still the best and my favorite. Don't get me wrong I think Stephen King is a great writer but In my opinion Swan Song surpasses The Stand. The reason I say that is because the story is far darker and foreboding than The Stand. The people in The Stand still had technology, food, housing and clear blue skies after the virus ran it's course. After the virus it was just a matter of getting rid of all the dead rotting corpses. The characters in Swan Song were left with nothing. And I do mean nothing. No clear blue skies folks. Oh no. I'm talking dark skies, nuclear fallout, radiation, contaminated water, burnt out buildings, cannibalistic mutants, bands of roaming armies and to top it off a completely inhuman shapeshifting monster who made Randall Flagg look like the Easter Bunny. Even Randall Flagg had his limits. He didn't harm children. The man-thing with the scarlet eye hunted children as well as adults and it had far more powers at it's command. At least you knew who Randall Flagg was. That thing in Swan Song could be anybody it wanted to be and it was exceedingly more evil and cunning. To survive after a virus has ran it's course and decimated half the population is one thing but to survive in the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust is completely another and Robert McCammon doesn't ease up in driving this point home throughout the book. In my opinion the characters in Swan Song were much stronger than the characters in The Stand. The good charcters were really good. So good you cried for them. But on the flipside the bad characters were so evil that you feared them as if they were in your room ready to slice your throat. Needless to say there aren't any gray or in between characters in Swan Song. Everybody is either really good or really evil. To this day I haven't read a novel that has invoked such strong emotions in me. The book really shows what humanity is capable of if pushed to the limits of it's endurance and that ultimately the good in the human spirit can triumph over any evil no matter what the odds.;1279073714000;Best Novel I've Ever Read!;AHEYM4UAWRGVHEJADG2LCQWERWRA;False

According to the author the Vietnamese are unknown and unknowable to westerners. (Somehow she has grasped their elemental essence.) They share so little in common with the rest of humanity that Stalinist communism is the only political system under which they will prosper and be true to their anthropological roots.  ""The moment has arrived for the narrow flame of revolution to cleanse the lake of Vietnamese society from the corruption and disorder of the American war.  It will have to come, for it is the only way the Vietnamese of the south can restore their country and their history to themselves.""  As it has been seen by the eyes of the world through the history of Southeast Asia since 1975 the South Vietnamese were truly fortunate to have been ""liberated"" and ""brought back to their heritage"" by a force as truly benevolent and peaceful as the government of the ""Democratic Republic of Vietnam.""<br /><br />Overly academic in an elitist anti-anticommunist way, this book has been required reading in all ""revisionist"" undergraduate history seminars and lectures since its first publication in 1972.

Reed loves the land he's worked since he was a child and Hattie has promised to sell it to him as soon as he has saved enough money to buy it.  Reed is engaged to Bessie Jane, a very young, very pretty, very spoiled and sometimes cruel girl whom he feels more loyalty than love, but won't marry until he finally owns land for himself.  Hattie and Reed plod along as best friends, almost like family until one day Ancil Drayton decides to court Miss Hattie.  Suddenly Reed isn't seeing Hattie as his five years older best friend but is seeing her as a woman.<br /><br />I really cared for this book but it is a little spotty.  I was a huge fan of Reed and Harmon, the secondary male lead, but I didn't quite know what to think about Hattie and Bessie Jane.  I found it really hard to swallow that Hattie was so desperate to marry that she was willing to put up with some of Ancil's antics.  When he tells her, ""Kissing that toothy mouth of yours wouldn't be no favor. Hell, I'd rather kiss a mule!"" I was just flabbergasted by the cruelty and absolutely SHOCKED that Hattie, this strong, smart, independent woman is going to put up with that just to get herself a man.  If a man is going to treat you like that while trying to impress you what is he going to be like in 5 or 10 years?  I lost a lot of respect for her that she didn't give him the old heave ho right then and there.<br /><br />I didn't like and didn't understand Bessie Jane.  She has been in love with Harmon since forever but she just tossed him over because her father didn't like him.  That I can believe, but I got tired of scene after scene (it felt like about 5) where it's just Harmon and her there, talking about how he wants her, how they both love each other but she is too much of a snob to be with him because he's poor. There was no emotional build in this story line, from beginning to end it was just a long flat line, that makes Bessie look very unsympathetic.  When she finally did decided what she really wanted I was like what?  Nothing has changed, Harmon hasn't said anything different but suddenly you're listening?  I think the author wants her to be someone you are a little ambivalent about, being the first thing she says in the book (the set up for her character) is Bessie referring to Hattie as Horseface Hattie.  My heart did break for Bessie when she sat there and watched her love for Harmon slipping away but in the end she was the one who tossed it away and even though she was so young and dependent on doing as her father said, it was hard for me to like her, even if I could empathize with her.  In the end she claims to really like and respect Hattie so I have no idea why she was so down right cruel and snobby about the idea of Hattie having a beau to begin with.<br /><br />I loved the sweet country charm and innocence of this book.  The way the farming was handle was wonderful, be it Hattie raising her prized Hampshire pigs or Reed's dream of one day growing rice in cotton country.  It was all so realistically described and Hattie and Reed's simple goals on their farm seemed to become very important.  This part of the story was perfectly handled and would much rather have had more time on the farm than to hear anything else about Bessie and Harmon sneaking around together.<br /><br />At it's heart this is a wonderful book, but to my mind the side romances of Hattie with Ancil and Harmon with Bessie just took away from the rest of this book which I really loved.  It was slow moving, but not boring, based in western culture, religion and morals but never preachy and had a hero who was always honest and kind.  I wish I could just edit out those few scenes, but I suppose the book wouldn't be what it is without them, but with them I can't give this 5 stars, so I have to say:<br /><br />4 stars.";1303183136000;Sweet Country Charm;AEACE2JAF73REY6KZ4AZ755XNUCA;False

1416997962;0;1416997962;5.0;SUMMARY<br />Having now completed The Beyonders trilogy, I can say that I enjoyed the series!<br />This is the final book in the trilogy (although I should say that the author left the possibility of more adventures for both Jason and Rachel).<br />The book begins with everyone in Mianamon, where the oracle delivers her final prophecy that guides them. Of all possible futures, there could be one where the evil Emperor Maldor is defeated and Lyrian is saved. After the oracle dies, they all set of on their quests and they must separate into two groups - Rachel in one and Jason in the other and they both have to succeed for Maldor to be beaten.  They “chase the prophecy”<br /><br />THE GOOD<br />More of the backstory of Nedwin, who I find such a sympathetic character and his end was quite sad, but honorable and I appreciated that Mull gave him his due. The parallel adventures of Rachel’s group and Jason’s group allowed the pace to move along without too much slow time in between. I also found that switching was not very distracting as it can be sometimes between story lines and POVs.<br /><br />THE HMMM<br />Why is there no table of contents? Is this a new thing? I am not liking that if so.<br /><br />THE INTERESTING<br />Ferrin’s end and  Nedwin’s end. As an adult I think I was a lot more affected by the end of their stories than a teen may be.<br /><br />FAVOURITE QUOTE<br />“We use lies to take the edge off life. We dream of a better tomorrow. We hide from our regrets and inadequacies. “<br />I liked this quote, because there is a fair bit of introspection in this book - more than you’d expect in a fantasy book for teens!<br /><br />RECOMMENDED FOR<br />Teens, young teens. In this installment, since both Jason and Rachel play pivotal roles I think this would appeal to both girls and boys. There is a sense of destiny and this was ordained, but Mull did a good job of taking pains to point out that some things may have been prophesied but at the end of the day, both Jason and Rachel had to have courage and do what they needed to do.;1453070765000;Fitting end for an enjoyable series!;AH47P7T4C3YVX3XWAZN57MQGNLHQ;False

0786965606;1;B0C8GJYMNH;5.0;"I started playing D&D with the Red Box as a kid in the 80's. At that time, you didn't tell most people you played because they would laugh and made fun of you. Only nerds and kids ""never going outside"" played such things. Even your own parents you had to be cautious. A few years later, I discovered the first edition of AD&D and played a few games with players only playing high-level characters. After finding a club, I could then meet much more people, and start playing AD&D 2nd Edition, and it's at that time that I bought my first books of the game, as a player.<br /><br />Until now, the 2nd Edition was the only one we played. We did see the 3 then 3.5 come out, checked it, but we already had almost everything published in the 2nd Edition and while the third edition seemed quite fine, it was not different enough to push us to adopt it, felt like a complex system to another complex system. We did use a few of the 4th edition boxes, especially the tiles and what the 4th Edition made us do is use, much more often, miniatures, but we kept to the 2nd.<br /><br />Then, came this edition, the 5th. WotC published the rules online, so we tried it. We found a game that was quite different, but it nonetheless felt very, very D&D. The pacing was much faster, we roleplayed more, it felt ""new"" and we really enjoyed ourselves. At the end of the evening, we realized that this 5th edition is what we've been waiting for all this years, and we rushed the next morning to buy the Core books.<br /><br />We invited friends, some who only played 2th, some who only played PathFinder in 1st or 2nd edition. All it takes is ONE game of us playing the 5th Edition to have those players get the books, and ask for seats for every game we run. The game is well designed, less many many books and too much rules (which is the sickness of Path Finder : a game designed for the pleasure of players with many rules and all is covered, but this leaves on fun room to the game master and clearly, PF is not designed with DMs in mind).<br /><br />I'm 45 this year. I still have the red box, still have the first edition and second edition first books (the first prints of each). All 2nd Ed books. And this 5th is the one that made me jump to a newer version. And I'm having fun. I'm having fun as a player, but it also made me start to master games (I only mastered Vampire and Cyberpunk 2020 until now).<br /><br />From my point of view, of a player that started from the very first edition, this is the best D&D edition I have ever seen. Reading each book I keep even today telling myself ""this is perfect : logical, easy, plenty room as a DM to improvise and keep good pacing"".<br /><br />Get this one kids : it's the best one we ever had.";1578150863760;Very good content, made me migrate from AD&D 2nd Edition !;AHAKMGDEAJOPWFXSZGVE6T2E746A;False

0802123988;31;0802123988;5.0;"The difference between Kliph Nesteroff’s The Comedians and the hundreds of other collections on comedians is that this is an order of magnitude above all the rest combined. While others collapse lives into three paragraphs, listing achievements quickly for a template, The Comedians is a narrative of eras. The chapters are on vaudeville, radio, nightclubs, television. The eras are populated and propelled by comedians making their way in the world, paying their dues, and sometimes risking their lives. The constraints of the medium, the politics and the time throw their careers into high relief. There is far more excitement, far more intrigue, far more curiosity in how they pulled it off than in any other such book.  And I have about 200 of them right here beside me. This is by far the best.<br /><br />The trek is all about change. How the eras changed the approach, how young comics fought the establishment, how differently the audience approaches comedy. It provides endless insight without dwelling too long on the accomplishments or famous lines of anyone. Most of the stories are (thankfully) not the standard, trademarked tales everyone’s heard, but other, more purposeful ones we likely have not encountered before. This too keeps the reader locked in. The transitions Nesterhoff employs – from radio to tv, late night to internet – are so integral they are elisions, seamless segués. The overall effect is pure pleasure for anyone interested in how the who’s who got that way, interacted, and how their era defined them. The evolution is markedly clear and relentless. The takeaways are endless.<br /><br />We even learn about the use of cigars by a certain generation (Burns, Benny, King, Youngman, Berle, Levenson, Leonard…), to let jokes set in or to stall for time while they switched gears when one failed. We learn that untold numbers of comics changed their names to Jack/Jackie and Joey/Joe E.  For some reason, this rated as enormously professional in the first half of the last century. The finest insight comes from Tommy Smothers, who didn’t hire writers so much as musicians, confounding, as he constantly did, the powers that employed him, if not the whole industry: “People in music are used to expressing themselves; they have more rhythm, better pacing,” he said, proving himself a far superior observer once again.<br /><br />Of course, not every comic is profiled or even mentioned. Missing entirely is the man who started it all, Mark Twain. At a time when there was nothing like it, Twain would entertain alone on a bare stage (with cigar). People laughed so hard their sides ached all the next day and no one could remember a single thing he said.  I know of only two others who could do the same, any time, with no preparation whatsoever and for endless hours without a break: Jonathan Winters and Peter Cook.<br /><br />Wondering how Nesteroff could possibly wrap it all up, he concludes simply with poignant words from Robin Williams about how comedy owned him. It was actually said better by Cocoa Brown: “Comedy is a jealous boyfriend I like to call Ike 'cause it beats the hell out of you every day, but I love it just the same.”<br /><br />David Wineberg";1446431658000;The dramatic,definitive study;AHWQUFAL2WRVEO3OQHYWBJ6EGAGQ;False

B072HLRW96;1;B072HLRW96;5.0;I read Andrew Blum's book about the weather with great interest. Blum explains how the simple act of picking up our iPhones to check the weather and then planning for how to dress or pack for a trip is a modern miracle of technology and a calculation that is unappreciated.<br /><br />Blum goes through many aspects of this miracle. First, he talks about the history of weather forecasting and the early pioneers who could only dream about collecting massive amounts of data and forecasting accurately into the future. Second, he goes into the modern weather data collection apparatus, with satellites circling above the earth, and how this was rapidly developed after World War II. He discusses the considerable infrastructure of weather modeling that infuses all of this data with physical calculations to make model predictions. Making accurate predictions has become a very competitive and specialized business that produces worldwide weather models.<br /><br />Third, he describes how these models are then fused with the input of local forecasters to predict the weather that we access on our TV or via an app. Finally, he talks about the all-important idea of diplomacy and data sharing, and how worldwide data sharing is so crucial for this infrastructure. The original WWW, in fact, was the world weather watch as opposed to the worldwide web.<br /><br />Altogether, this was a great read that I would highly recommend to those interested in recent synergistic technological progress.;1577072645668;Thoughts on Blum's Weather Machine: Great account of a recent but unappreciated scientific miracle;AHZINRKQFKW77A6TX2DYDDOSLBQQ;False

Actually both are keys to this eminently readable biography. As one who struggles with the simple concepts of physics, I was delighted to be taken, step by step, into the world of thought experiments. Key to the iconoclastic revolution he began, Einstein's thought experiments actually provide the reader with the means to begin understanding his famous equation, e=mc² and its tremendous impact on the world that resonates even today.<br /><br />Einstein turns out to be far more complicated than the kindly, befuddled scientist of popular culture. Isaacson successfully captures the many nuances of Einstein's character. As the biography progressed through Einstein's initial fame after his scientific publication of 1905, I became aware of Isaacson's underlying theme in this biography: that of ""fame"" and how fame and popularity merged and began to dominate popular culture -- to a great degree due to this gentle scientist and revolutionary.";1231875713000;A Biography for the Layperson: Einstein;AFOOSTANF2VH7WQ5ZQW6V5N6SW4Q;False

But the bad guys are on to their purpose and are willing to kill to gain the profits. A story of adventures and relationships between brothers, families, and friends that meld and divide.

B000721DBQ;5;B000721DBQ;3.0;"Ehhh.  Don’t you hate it when you spend years looking forward to something and the letdown is so overwhelming it just makes it seem twice the size it probably is?<br /><br />When it came to HAVOK & WOLVERINE: MELTDOWN, I’d seen ads for this forever in comics back in the day, and I loved that image on the cover of the first issue.  I wanted to read this book so badly, based on that cover alone.  Also, Havok and Wolverine?  That’s a team-up?  Really?  Alright, I’m down for it.<br /><br />Well, it took a while--28 years--but I finally found the book and was able to read it.  Not that it was ever hidden from me, I never really sought it out.  It wasn’t like I was desperate to read it or anything.  If I’d seen the individual issues when they first came out, I would have picked them up, but once it was gone, it was gone from my memory as well.  But then I happened to come across it on Comixology recently, so I bought the single issues for $1.99 each.  That’s better than the original $3.50 cover price.  This was prestige format, thick paper with card stock covers, pricey for 1988.  $3.50 would be cheap for a single standard comic.  But I digress.  But before I got a chance to work down to it in my Comixology reading queue, I did myself one better by finding the original individual issues at my local comic shop in the back issue bins for $0.99 each!!!  Hell yes, I bought them.  So what if I already had it digital; I like displaying my books and you can’t display an electronic file.  So of course I bought them.<br /><br />Now?  After having read it?  Hmmmm.  Well, I don’t regret the purchase.  If nothing else, I have the original 4-issue run in mint condition, so that’s cool.  As for the story….<br /><br />Havok and Wolverine--X-Men, both--are on vacation in Mexico, apparently having challenged each other to go the entire vacation without using their powers.  First to lose buys the beer for the rest of the trip.  But even not using his claws, Wolverine manages to end up in trouble.  A band of thugs show up at their motel room looking for a fight so Havok and Wolverine take off in the first car they see.  Unfortunately, it belongs to a woman in the parking lot.  To keep her from getting shot by the guns the thugs are firing, they tell her to hop in and they run.<br /><br />Wouldn’t you know it, the woman who owns the car is in on a scam to kidnap Havok and kill Wolverine.  Unfortunately, Wolverine’s mutant healing ability is stronger than the fifteen darts filled with bubonic plague he is shot up with and, despite their intentions, he makes it.<br /><br />Havok is only shot with one dart and he makes it, too, but when he wakes up, finds himself in a hospital with a woman who says she nursed him back to heath.  In reality, she’s working for the enemy, a mysterious Soviet agent named Meltdown who wants the use of Havok’s power, his ability to “convert solar energy to plasma”, thereby giving himself infinite strength and power to conquer the world.<br /><br />But Wolverine isn’t going to let his pal and teammate go that easily, so he sets about doing what he does best, which is kicking a## and not taking names cuz he’s too busy kicking a##.<br /><br />Their trials take them out of Mexico, into the Carpathian Mountains for some reason, and finally into India where the pair reunite and battle the vicious Meltdown in the middle of a nuclear reactor that’s about three seconds away from melting down itself.<br /><br />It may sound like the good idea for a plot, but the execution was lacking.  And that’s surprising to me, because it was written by Louise and Walter Simonson, two legends in the industry--one of whom is one of my favorite creators of all time.  What keeps this book from really taking off is the dialogue.  A lot of formal speech with a lack of contractions make it come across stiff and unnatural.  Plus the whole plot just seems more convoluted and complex than it needs to be.  I still don’t see why the trail couldn’t just lead them to India in the first place.  The pit stop at the mountain castle did NOTHING but fill space and stretch the story out to fill four books instead of three.<br /><br />Also, I had a bit of a problem with the characterization of Wolverine.  I’ve recently been reading a lot of old Daredevil comics and in there his enhanced senses feel more natural and believable, but in this book, the Simonsons have Wolverine saying things like, “Scent indicated Alex took off in that plane with his heart racin’…” and “…Alex’s scene’s normal.  He’s not worried.  Alex doesn’t know!  Took this dirt road.  Gotta follow.  Stop ‘em ‘fore she gets whatever she’s after!  They headed up towards the mountains.  What’s that?  SNIFF  Petrol? … Too late!  She’s gotten away.  An’ he is goin’ with her willingly?  But in a bi-plane?!?”<br /><br />How the hell does he know that by scent?  He doesn’t!  They’re making this stuff up and doing a poor job of it.  He’s got heightened senses, yes, but he doesn’t have MAGIC senses!  So while the plot was more complicated than it needed to be, the real tragedy here was the dialogue and characterization.<br /><br />The art wasn’t terrible.  It wasn’t beautiful.  Jon J. Muth and Kent Williams split the art duties with one taking the Wolverine plot threads and the other taking Havok.  Both artists painted their pages with varying degrees of success.  Wolverine looks like a wild-haired hobo while Havok, in several shots outside of his costume, which is most of the book, reminded me a LOT of Peter Capaldi’s Twelfth Doctor.  Which I’m sure wasn’t the intention since this book came out in 1988 … or WAS it???  The Doctor IS a time traveler, after all…  Hmm.<br /><br />Neither had particularly inventive page payouts.  Action scenes from both painters felt rushed and done as asides to fills pace.  I didn’t get a sense of passion from anyone working on this book.<br /><br />I’ve read worse stories, of course, but for a team-up between Havok and Wolverine, the very idea seems so out of place, I hoped the execution would make more sense of it than this did.  But this is the book they gave us, so…<br /><br />Oh well.  Like I said, not the worst thing I’ve ever read.  Definitely forgettable, though.

You will not  find a serious historian who believes this story even remotely plausible.

0307278123;0;0307278123;5.0;Thought provoking and sometimes downright jaw dropping. Greene presents a case for why modern developments in physics may imply the existence of various different kinds of multiverses. His scientific explanations were difficult, but in my opinion, easier than Stephen Hawkings'. He has a great gift for using familiar analogies to explain concepts impossible to visualize, such as the 9 spatial dimensions of string theory, or quantum tunneling events. It turns out certain conceptions of a multiverse are a natural progression of some well established scientific theories such as quantum mechanics. Even more surprising is that nearly all of Greene's multiverses may someday be supported or contradicted by experimental evidence. Only one proposed multiverse he discusses is forever removed from any potential observation by principle. Before reading this book I had always thought of a multiverse as an obscure and unnecessary concept evoked arbitrarily by scientists for philosophical reasons. Greene managed to really shake my views by explaining that actual scientific principles give rise to various views of a multiverse. Our world is truly an amazing place that seems to become larger and more astounding with every generation of scientific advances.;1405902217000;Incredibly fascinating;AHX4CFKLFYQ2BCXZQHOFZKRIXTZA;False

1250121280;0;1250121280;5.0;Over the years, the Kate Burkholder series has definitely been one that I can count on each installment to be a fast-paced and exciting read! And this ninth installment is certainly no exception to that rule! I actually had saved the seventh and eighth books to read, so that I was able to read all three of these consecutively – my preferred reading style for series! It’s been a lot of fun to read them and revel in the series!<br /><br />This one is a nice addition to the series because it once again offers more of Kate’s childhood and past. It has an absolutely absorbing storyline! While this isn’t one of the more unpredictable entrants to the series, seeing some things coming doesn’t detract at all from the pacing or the overall excitement. But, maybe I was able to more easily guess the plot’s turns because I just read the previous two? Either way, I do appreciate that unlike some of the earlier books in the series, this one is more careful to not give away past plot points to make it an easier starting point for those who are picking up the series midstream (though I wouldn’t recommend starting here – it’s best enjoyed in order!).<br /><br />As far as the overarching series plots, this one serves more to fill in Kate’s past than the central romance. But, there may be some foundation laid with Painter’s Mill politics that may pick up in the tenth book. I am definitely looking forward to seeing what comes next!;1498847041807;Great Ninth Book in the Series!;AH2GI5KLJT2AKVCYXV2OIIGGLT4Q_1;False

With a new hairstyle and a sliver of confidence, she attacks the role daily…because since she was the scholarship kid at a hoity-toity District of Columbia prep school, Jamie has never quite belonged. Especially when it comes to her longtime BFF and secret crush, Ford Conway III.<br /><br />As the oldest son of a Supreme Court justice and the world’s savviest society lady, Ford Conway was meant to attend prep school and grow into someone great. His mom never predicted he’d befriend the charity case. Much to her chagrin, as young kids and college classmates, Ford and Jamie were inseparable.<br /><br />The duo shared all their secrets, until graduation, when they shared a magical night.<br /><br />That is, until Ford forced himself to run away from his family’s political ties and his growing feelings for Jamie Silver.<br /><br />Now a famous Hollywood producer, Ford makes his own rules. Except when his father becomes gravely ill, and he’s forced to come home and runs head-on into the only woman who ever captured his heart.

0980003431;1;0980003431;4.0;"The Crown Conspiracy's world and characters are familiar types from the fantasy genre, but the twisting main plot and complex world and backstory were intriguing enough to grab and hold my interest.  Sullivan reveals the plot piecemeal, allowing the mystery to build, while keeping a fairly quick pace.  The greater world is well-developed and familiar, but not formulaic or derivitive. Characters are strong and dimensioned, and while easily recognizable to readers of the genre, are unusual, charming, and genuine. Dialog, as it often is in fantasy novels, is not particularly strong, waffling between modernity and a nod toward ""period"" (though that's a questionably concept in an imagined world...) but it is, at least, true to its characters' personalities and motivations.  Sullivan's prose is otherwise well crafted and skillful, focused on moving plot, characters, and, importantly, action, without hindering the pace.

082033071X;10;082033071X;5.0;"The year 1947 turned out to be a midpoint in the environmental activism of Marjory Stoneman Douglas, not the culmination some expected. In this year, President Truman dedicated the Everglades National Park. Stoneman's environmental classic The Everglades: River of Grass was also published. But as anyone living today knows, the Everglades was not preserved for all time. In 1947, Douglas still had 50 years of life ahead of her. She died in 1998 at the age of 108. During the second half of her life, she continued to work tirelessly to build on her earlier, partial successes in preserving the Everglades and playing a lead in environmentalism.<br /><br />Though not as well-known or celebrated as John Muir or Rachel Carson even by environmentalists, Douglas was a central figure in reformulating the public's perspective on the environment as she focused particularly on the preservation of the Everglades. ""More than any other single writer or activist, [she] embodied the American environmental century--that period from the closing of the frontier to the end of the twentieth century during which environmental concerns rose to the fore in American politics and society."" (from the Foreword by Paul S. Sutter)<br /><br />Davis's voluminous biography takes in the full scope of Douglas's life from shaky marriage, noted author of stories and novels, prominent forebears and influence of her father who was cofounder of the Miami Herald, and feminist leader, to the environmental activism and projects she was involved in, especially the recognition of the place of the Everglades in Florida's and the U.S.'s environmental heritage and its preservation for which she is most remembered. At appropriate spots in the straightforward chronological biography, Davis goes into the legal problems of the man Douglas was briefly married to, her work on the homefront in World War II, the path of her literary career, and specifics of environmental legislation. The author also relates scientific information as appropriate for readers to understand these topics and concomitantly appreciate Douglas's knowledge of environmentalism and her activist approach focusing on issues and pressing for their resolution.<br /><br />In this first biography on this pioneering environmentalist--which for most readers will be an introductory biography--Davis, as was his aim, gets in all the biographical material as gleaned from references in notes running more than 125 pages. As all this in a lifespan of over 100 years is presented on the same par, as more or less indiscriminate, unevaluated information, there is little perspective or drama. The tactics of the Florida developer Broward, Douglas's work on legislation in Washington, critical points in saving the Everglades, Douglas's feminist activism, and the many other subjects are treated mostly as varied aspects of her life and work. Despite Davis's diffident, though highly informed stance as author, Douglas's unique achievements shine through.";1235927361000;struggle to preserve the Everglades by a leading 20th-century environmentalist;AHJDN2ZTRGK3TY6EN6T4S5A6UY7Q;False

0316129062;1;0316129062;5.0;"It was hard to believe that I had any problems with Leviathan Wakes after reading this fantastic sophomore followup. I don’t usually come across second novels that I enjoy so much more than the first, but Caliban’s War is definitely an exception. Where the first novel seemed to lose control of itself about halfway through, the second is as concise as a tight beam. The plot is more focused, the characters have clear goals and the action is fast and splendid. The blurb of praise on the cover of these novels saying that they’re as close to a feature film as you’ll get in book form couldn’t be more correct. This is one of the best science fiction books I’ve read in a long time.<br /><br />Looking back on Leviathan Wakes, I think if I were to read it again now I’d enjoy it much more now, even though my original complaints still stand. The things I didn’t like about the first book are made better here. Caliban’s War also has more POV characters than Leviathan (four, instead of two) and the characters are much more enjoyable. Well, a couple of them are anyway.<br /><br />Holden - Our primary protagonist returned from book one. If this series had a single main character, Holden would be it. I honestly didn’t like Holden too much as a character in Leviathan Wakes. He always acts on impulse and does what he feels is right despite the consequences. He still is very much the same, but he’s learned from his past mistakes (as has his crew) so now at least he’s a bit more conscious of when he’s about to destroy humanity. Despite this annoying character flaw, James Holden is pretty enjoyable, more so now than book one. He’s the dumb, lovable captain who wants to do right by his crew.<br /><br />Prax - Praxadike Meng is a scientist forced into exile as his life’s work is destroyed by war. In the midst of this war, he loses his daughter. He then meets James Holden who vows to help him get his daughter back and not only because it’s the right thing to do. His daughter may have been the unwilling participant in certain studies involving a certain alien substance we’ve seen before. And this is where the primary plot of Caliban’s War begins. Aside from his necessity to the story, Prax is a rather annoying character. Like Holden, he’s prone to act without thinking and unlike Holden, he doesn’t have a military background so his actions tend to be not only poorly planned but dangerous as well. I understand his character is meant to be this way, and the fact that I continually find myself frustrated with what he’s doing just means he’s well written.<br /><br />Bobbie - If Prax could have a polar opposite character, it would be Bobbie. Bobbie is a bad ass Martian Marine with, wait for it... power armor. And not just the boring old power armor from the Fallout games. With this armor, she can move with incredible speed, fight with incredible strength and move about in any environment, including vacuum. Now this all might sound fun but you’re probably thinking, “well that doesn’t sound too interesting. She could just kick anyone’s ass right?” Well, sort of. But still, she’s a fantastic character. As a Martian who’s known nothing but war and has only ever lived under domes in air restricted environments, she finds herself on Earth, a planet of vast openness and blue skies, drawn into a political scheme she was never prepared for. As great of a character as she is, she’s only runner up for favorite character in Caliban’s War.<br /><br />Avarasala - Avarasala is a politician on Earth (I can’t remember precisely what position she holds and I’m too lazy to dig the book back out of my closet) and is my favorite character of this story. She’s a grandma with a potty mouth and a scheming mastermind. She has my favorite dialogue of the book and I found myself laughing quite often while reading her chapters. Like Varys in the Ice and Fire books, she’s got eyes and ears everywhere and seems to know almost everything going on throughout the system. While she definitely is keeping tabs on Holden and his shenanigans, what really concerns her is what’s happening on Venus since the protomolecule decided to make it’s home there.<br /><br />As you can guess, all of these characters get tied up in the crazy web of intrigue and war that is the fallout of the protomolecule. These characters all work fantastically with one another, even if they hate each other, which is often the case.<br /><br />As for the action, this may be a contender for best action in any sci-fi book for me. And it’s not just the scope of the action, or the frequency of it that causes me to remember it so well. It’s how the characters see and describe it and the way it pulled me in and feel like I was there. Without giving away too much, there is a sequence where a character is fleeing from point A to point B on the surface of a moon while above him he sees a panorama of countless ships locked in battle against the backdrop of Jupiter. The imagery conjured here helped me visualize it with the clarity of a film. My brain could even put a soundtrack to it. I find the action sequences of many sci-fi novels disappointing because they are lacking that very thing that made them so great in this book; that personal touch that pulls you in. And it’s not just the action scenes that are given this treatment. There is no lack of a sense of wonder in these books, scenes where the character simply takes a moment to look at something amazing and realize it’s amazing.<br /><br />I very much enjoyed this book and series and would recommend it to anyone. I’ve now read books 1-3, and while I would not rate those as highly as I rate this one, I recommend them all. They’re part hard sci-fi, part space opera, with a dash of horror, mystery and politics (maybe some romance too) so there’s a little bit in them for everyone. Let’s just hope that the SyFy channel gives them the treatment they deserve.";1439369667000;The Expanse's sophomore entry far exceeds the first;AFN2NHBOTS2V7GXEAA4R2EN747BA;False

Bryson speeds through literally hundreds of names and events, most of which you have never heard of, nor will ever hear of again, even in the presence of other history buffs/teachers. Worst of all, his humor is of the sort that can ONLY appeal to snobbish intellectuals and professors.<br />All too often, Bryson gives significant figures and events only small bits of print, before moving hastily on to a series of entirely obscure people, whose contributions were not necessarily significant in their own right in any way. Indeed, a significant portion of this book is devoted to relatively unimportant people whose only value was that they in some way or another had a domino affect on someone more noteworthy.<br />The pace at which this book moves from one worthless anecdote/person to another is so fast that only those with photographic memories will be able to retain more than 10% after reading this book.<br />All in all, I would say that the worthless anecdotes outweigh the truly historical events and figures by about 20 to 1 in this book. At minimum. Most people should not waste their money if they really want to learn the most important things about history and science.<br />A final note. I was not seeking a book chock full of complicated science when I read this book. On the other hand, I was hoping for a book that generally focused on all the highy points of scientific history, so that I could forge a roadmap in my own mind.

General Grievous uses the weapon to destroy three Venator Class Star Destroyers, one of which is commanded by Jedi Master Plo Koon. Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano investigate. While Anakin and his new Padawan find Plo Koon, the rescue mission winds-up in the same danger that initially destroyed the Republic ships.

When Julia's husband Michael has a heart attack and is brought back to life with the use of a defibrillator, he is a changed person, and he goes about the task of changing Julia, also. The two of them have lived a very wealthy, extravagant life together, but their love for each other has taken a back seat over the years. As Michael sets out to show Julia that the money isn't as important as their love, she has to decide for herself how she feels about giving it up, and going back to the time when she and Michael only had each other. This poignant novel touches the heart with its message that love really is the most important thing.;1308536211000;Rich In Love;AH4BBYBPA7KN6SWIYI74RDETPMUQ;False

Charlotte is a teenager struggling with her destiny and longing for a ""normal"" life. The reader finds themselves just as torn as she is, unsure what path she should take. This book could have easily been expanded to 500 pages, but stays to around 270. Unfortunately, I feel that there could have been more back story written in.

It starts out seductively like a dark fairy tale as the mysterious outsider comes to live in a rural Irish village inhabited by rather sheltered, naive, well meaning folk.  Here Ms. O'Brien drew me in with her intimate and witty rendering of these good people trying to figure out what this visitor is all about.  Innocently they allow him in.  Fidelma, a beautiful childless woman in a dead marriage, makes a rather Faustian bargain with the man.  Soon he is revealed to be an evil war criminal on the lam, and Fidelma brutalized as a result of her relationship goes to London where she joins other outcasts and victims of  malevolence as they try to survive and find a home.  Through Fidelma we witness  evil and, in detail, its far reaching effect.  We also witness repair as the victims find their courage and voices.  The novel covers a lot of ground and can be a little overwhelming in its scope.  At the same time it is liberating to travel along unconstrained by tidy novelistic threads.  Ms. O'Brien's writing is gorgeous; her characters are compelling and her story is timely and heartbreaking.";1486418408000;It starts out seductively like a dark fairy tale as the mysterious outsider comes ...;AFI3HK5C7HTGKWQXCGCLITV6RAQQ;False

I was interested in this book thinking it might somehow be about Johnny Vegas, the Johnny Vegas, the overweight acerbic funnyman from St Helens. Once I realised it was not, I knew it would be very difficult to read the book without that image in my head. David Baldacci managed a lead character called Oliver Stone, though his character had at least stolen the name from the left-wing film director, and had his excuses lined up for doing so. Maybe it's a good book, but if you're going to write a book about Elvis Pressley, it had better be about the singer or have some damn good reason why he's got the same name, otherwise it's going to be a tough read.;1360370185000;What's in a name.;AEEHVICU73I5KUQXMKIK24XFOP6A;False
1600090052;8;1600090052;2.0;"It's really good I had low expectations when I picked this up, or otherwise I'd be crushed.<br /><br />To the point; I can't really tell if Let Dai has a brilliant story or not because the translation is the worst trainwreck of mangled linguistics and see-sawing diction levels I've ever seen in a manga/manghwa. Really. There's embaressingly obvious typos like ""girls"" written as ""grils"" and the way the characters talk is like long streams of profanity laced with SAT vocab words. Consequently, I couldn't feel the tension of fight scenes (whoo! brainy trashtalk!), or empathy in the sad moments (oh no! what a horrible  moment...only, why does your grammer sound so awkward?) It's so awful I can't even tell if the translators were fluent in English. It's much worse than the amatuer work I see online, and sometimes even the subject-verb agreement sounded a little off. There's a lot of flowery language, which could have been poetic in Korean, but sounds oddly ridiculous here. It can pop up even when the context in inappropriate. (And in a comic about urban gang life and NOT Victorian England, that's rather often.) As a result, characters seem like they're responding to every little thing with melodrama: mixed metaphors and corny, detailed nicknames galore.<br /><br />There's a lot of internal dialogue too, which is in a different font than the spoken word. Unfortunately, it's an uglier, stiffer font and is just as inconsistent. And it can't salvage the pretty awful character development. Jaehee is probably supposed to be a model kid with a strong sense of justice, and Dai a beautiful boy whose alluring complexities somehow convince others to empathize with his extreme sadism. It's an excellent premise, but is quickly foiled by too spontaneous emotional statements. In a heartbeat,JaeHee goes to the ""dark side"", some struggling with his morals be damned. Dai goes psycho, forgetting to be charming first. In other words--climaxes aren't really climaxes becuase they randomly insert themselves into the story without build-up. Scenes without substance that try to be touching end up with a ""this is just too cheesy"" effect instead. Either that, or you will simply be going ""WTF?""<br /><br />I really hope Let Dai gets better...it's 15 volumes long!( Could the translators keep making mistakes like this?)I don't really regret buying this, because I was making a gamble based on the cover. The cover really  is the book's best trait--the realistic-style, pencil drawings of Dai (front) and Jaehee(back) are somber and quietly beautiful, with delicate linework and blue tones. The finish is matte instead of glossy, unlike most manga/manghwa, which suits the gentle corruption Dai symbolizes. There's an added plus of not leaving fingerprints. The art on the inside is considerably blander, but nothing to complain about.<br /><br />All in all, I didn't hate Let Dai--I was sincerely interested in what was going to happen. Dai is a cruel, disturbing person who acts angelic on whim; Jaehae both fears him and gravitates towards him. It's impossible not to feel intrigued by a current of grim uncertainty as Junhae staggers between dreading and anticipting Dai. I like Let Dai for the basic framework of its plot and its beautiful, unusual cover.But with a translation so awful it's distracting, poorly choreographed series of events, and overblown writing that has all the subtlety of a frying pan to to face, I can't recommend this book to anyone else.";1163729233000;Ouch.;AEQ4633WTVMWTJSKPO3LWGSOBXEA;False

B00GOHI8Q6;1;B00GOHI8Q6;2.0;"Note: I am reviewing this book by comparing it to other historical thrillers, not to novels in general.<br /><br />Do you as a reader know what &#34;ratlines&#34; were? They were the secret underground escape routes from post-WW2 Germany and Austria that ran through Italy and Spain and Switzerland to help Nazis fend-off prosecution by emigrating to &#34;friendly&#34; South American countries. Countries that looked the other way - their voices silenced by Nazi money. The ratlines were financed by monies expropriated by the Nazis from Jews and other victims. Sometimes the funds were placed in Swiss bank accounts, but often the money - sometimes in gold-bricks and cold, hard cash - was hidden by the fleeing Nazis OR handled by men who operated the &#34;paths to freedom&#34;. Often the lines were organised by members of the Catholic clergy; friendly - or at least sympathetic - to the Nazis they were helping evade justice.<br /><br />These ratlines have been the subject of a few novels - Frederick Forsythe's &#34;The Odessa File&#34;, among them - and are of interest to most arm-chair historians. It's a little difficult to make both the concept and the reality of ratlines dull to a reader, but Stuart Neville in his new novel/political thriller, &#34;Ratlines&#34;, has accomplished just that. Set in Ireland in 1963, on the eve of the President Kennedy's official visit to the country, Neville has concocted a plot involving Austrian Otto Skorzeny who had been &#34;de-Nazified&#34; by the post-war German government and was living a secluded and fitful life in Ireland. Skorzeny, of course, was the ace German pilot who managed the capture and escape of Benito Mussolini in 1943 from Italian hands after the fall of his government and carried him to freedom in Germany. He also managed to bedevil General Eisenhower during the Battle of the Bulge in late 1944 by a plot to smuggle German soldiers into Allied army companies. (Don't ask - though it would be the subject of quite an interesting work of non-fiction if a good writer could get his/her hands on the story).<br /><br />Anyway, Skorzeny has entered Ireland with the cooperation of the Irish government. But suddenly other ex-Nazis who have found refuge in the country are found brutally murdered. &#34;Someone&#34; in the Irish government is concerned about these murders and assigns Albert Ryan, who works for a shady branch of the government security department, to investigate the case. When I wrote &#34;someone&#34;, I meant it in quotation marks, because I was never sure who was who in the Irish government or the police. There were a whole bunch of people - all shady - who were after Skorzeny first, Ryan second, and the Nazi billions most of all, who were not who they were supposed to be. Now, that's okay in a well-written thriller - a little political and moral ambiguity is par for the course - but this book degenerated into a virtual who's who of killers and torturers. And I'm still wondering who got the Nazi coin - everyone and his brother seemed to be after it, including possible members of Israel's Mossad.  By the book's end, I wasn't sure who-was-who and I didn't much care.<br /><br />Maybe I'm picky about my political thrillers. This one was over-written and over-killed.

1416524592;1;1416524592;4.0;"First, I'm not much of a fiction reader, apart from the greats... I mainly read philosophy and history; but I do love the Star Trek mythos, and with the marked exception of Enterprise the series have been superb. Every now and then I pick up a Star Trek novel just because I miss TOS/TNG so much. Most of the stories I've read I would consider at least average.<br /><br />The first story in this book actually makes the mirror counterpart to Enterprise interesting, and is very well-written.  I looked forward to reading more to the very end.  The author gave originally lame characters vibrant new life in this mirror universe.<br /><br />The 2nd story was even better.  Spanning a longer period of time, this story artfully lays out how Spock would most likely have acted after returning to his own space.  I was sorry to see it end, and surprised at how dark the ending was and what an uncertain future it set up. But not only was it a fascinating story, it laid the groundwork for unlimited new story possibilities.<br /><br />Then came number 3.  This story was bland, poorly imagined, and the characters were simple and boring (even Picard).  I spent my time trying to skip over sections of irrelevant conversations/interactions between tertiary characters who were neither important to the story or worth caring about.  What's worse, it takes the previous story's ending at face value, injecting no variables or course correction to get the Empire back on track.  The problem with this is that as a mirror to the Trek universe we know, it would unfold as similar events-- case in point, as a result of this story there could be no ISS Enterprise D (or B, C or E for that matter).  The parallel paths of the two universes would have been broken by Spock.  It is likely that shortly thereafter, some event would have occurred that would have lined the realities back up... otherwise they are no longer mirrors, which by definition is impossible.<br /><br />Okay, enough of that, story 3 is poorly conceived and poorly written.  By a man, apparently, who lives with his parents.  I don't know how this story made it into the book, but it's bad enough I doubt I will read book 2.";1176407129000;All 4 Stars for the First 2 Stories;AGRVZ5CHAYPWJ32REEMHHPYRSL4A;True

Their friendship was weakened by Helghul’s ambition, and destroyed when Theron, the girl they both loved, fell in love with Marcus. When Theron and Marcus engaged in a special coupling, they became soulmates - able to find each other in all their next lives. But when Marcus stumbles in on Helghul performing a horrifying ceremony that goes against everything their people believe in, he knows he must act. He ends up swallowing a potion that will allow him to remember all of his past lives - so he can save the world from Helghul, who also swallows the potion. As the story progresses, we get to see some of Marcus’ other lives - where he never stops searching for Theron, his soulmate.

0982144342;1;0982144342;5.0;"This wonderful book begins with a prologue taking place in a dense forest in the Province of Misiones, Argentina.  The year is 1960.  A man, Gerhardt Lesser, who has lived in the jungle for many years is about to have his prayers answered.  This man was a master builder in Germany during World War II and a favorite of Hitler himself.  He has worked nearly five years to build this bunker where the Reich could hide artwork that had been stolen from the Jewish people.  As the trucks bearing this treasure started to appear, this man was faced with another person that had come with the stolen artifacts to inspect the hiding place.  This man, called Ricardo Klement, checked everything out and said to Lesser ""You have done good work.  Did you do this alone?""  Lesser replied, ""My son helped me but he's not here now.  He will be back to help put everything in place and make a list of all contents.""  Lesser was a bit unnerved by the attitude of Klement and wanted to reach his son after he did the inventory.  He had a lot to do and started right away to inventory the artifacts.  Some time later he found out that Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann had been captured by Mossad agents.  He had been living under the alias ""Ricardo Klement.""  Gerhardt needed to reach his son and tell him but, before he could, one of Ricardo's men appeared to check the inventory.  He tried to run away from Eichmann's man and ran into the bunker, grabbed a couple of pieces of metal and carved on the walls above the various cubicles that were holding the art.  Gerhardt knew that this was the end for him and needed to warn his son.  Gerhardt was attacked and killed by the Nazi.  The Nazi then went to open the containers and opened one after another.  He was very disappointed as the place was empty.<br /><br />And, now the fun begins!!!  We move ahead to the present day in New York City where Dr. Gerson Asher is busy at work at the Lenox Hill Hospital.<br />Dr. Asher is a prominent New York surgeon and ex-Navy SEAL who spent his adolescent years in the care of his grandfather, Max, who lived in Argentina.  One evening Gerson receives a call from his grandfather who is very frightened and tells him that he is flying into New York from Argentina the next morning.  Gerson sees his grandfather fatally stabbed by two men as he comes through an arrival gate at Kennedy Airport.  Grandfather Max has a letter in his pocket with information that sends Gerson on a dangerous mission, looking for various clues that Max has left for him to unravel.  This search will lead him on a disturbing path from New York to Argentina on the trail of stolen World War II artifacts, war criminals and the killers of his grandfather.  He will get help from Nicole, a geneticist from the NY hospital who is helping to decipher the clues that Max left behind.  Also, a Rabbi's daughter, who works with an organization of Nazi-hunters in Argentina and a couple of Mossad agents are thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />I have to say that my very favorite author in this genre is Jack Higgins but I must admit that, after reading Counsel of the Wicked, Mr. Kusminsky is running a close second.  This is a debut novel.  Mr. or I should say Doctor Kusminsky is a surgeon and he is of Argentinian descent and is an excellent writer of World War II fiction and certainly seems to have done his research well.

1501175513;0;1501175513;3.0;"I did learn a couple of new things by reading this book. One was that only one of Trump's advisors, Peter Navarro, favored Trump's trade wars. Everyone else was a free-trader, and argued against imposing tariffs. The other was that an Afghan official told Trump the Chinese were extracting minerals from Afghanistan, and Trump immediately went to his people and demanded that the U.S. get involved in that. What were we there for? We should be in  there getting the minerals! His advisors tried to explain to him that there was no American policy that justified such a rapacious approach, and that it would look bad in the world's eyes, etc. In other words, they tried to give Trump a legal and strategic view, and, as we know, Trump doesn't understand law and is incapable of strategic thinking, because he is ""transactional,"" meaning he can only keep one thing in his mind at a time. Going in and robbing Afghanistan of its minerals is, I guess, what his followers meant when they said Trump would ""run the government like a business.""<br /><br />Beyond those two scenes, there wasn't a great deal that we haven't seen covered in the news, although there was a bit more detail, toward the end of the book, about some of the negotiations between Special Counsel Mueller and Trump's former lawyer, John Dowd. Dowd apparently quit because he feared Trump would not take his advice to refuse to talk to Mueller. Dowd didn't think Trump would have much liability so long as he didn't testify, but that if he testified, he'd be toast, because he'd be a sucker for a perjury trap. Woodward ends the book on this note, that Dowd knew Trump was ""a f---ing liar.""  That's not exactly news, though.<br /><br />The big question going forward (and the book can't answer it) is whether Mueller has something more than what Dowd was able to conclude that he had. Dowd was worried about it, but didn't think what he'd seen amounted to much. So we're still waiting on that one.<br /><br />As others have pointed out, Woodward's writing is nothing to brag about. I remember the scene in the movie, ""All the President's Men"" where Bernstein (played by Dustin Hoffman) has appropriated Woodward's notes and is re-writing them, to polish them up a bit. Woodward knows he's no stylist. He's a newspaperman. What you get here is what he knows.<br /><br />Last point. You can tell from some of the scenes who the source is, or you can make a good guess. If only two people are in the room and one of them is Trump, you know the source is the other guy, because Woodward did not talk to Trump.  Or if there are several people in the scene, and there are repeated references to what somebody was thinking, the source is probably the guy doing the thinking.";1546377209352;A Few Insights;AFDZ2EY2AIX57LN5FPRCD4FT6IKA;False

The Mogadorians are kind of like an early version of current world citizens, knowing they have an environmental problem but refusing to fix it until its too late and they have to take over another planet in order to survive. Citizens of Lorien did the opposite and now have a fresh planet and are blessed by the planet with their Legacies.<br /><br />John, as we know him in this book, is one of the 9 that escaped the invasion the day the Mogadorians came to Earth, and is meant to try to go back to restore Lorien to its former glory. However, the Mogadorians have come to Earth and are hunting down the 9 one by one in some strange numerical order that they have. John knows that he is going to be the fourth to die, and so him and his protector Henri have to go to Ohio to try to escape them for as long as possible.<br /><br />John falls in love with a girl named Sarah at his school, becomes best friends with a boy named Sam who is ironically obsessed with science fiction and aliens, and he is beginning to settle in. At the same time, his Legacies begin to appear since he turned 15 and he gains the power of being fireproof and also is supposed to have the power of telekinesis which he struggles with.

This novel has a slow start to me. I struggled to make it past the first 100 or so pages, but after that the book picks up the pace and I found myself drawn in. I enjoyed the small teenage romance brewing under the secrets of John and his life. I admired how John befriended Sam, a formerly quiet and lonely boy. The bond of Henri and John only grew throughout the book as John started to step into his own personal responsibilities as the fourth hero. I am not sure how I will do with the rest of the series as I struggled quite a bit more than I would have liked with this book, but if all goes well I should be able to finish the Lorien Legacies series.;1595097608447;So-so YA book about aliens.;AFE35SRDCGEF6ZUHXNW67I53W2NA;False

As an article from the NPR website says, when writing this book, Kerouac was:  ""improvising endlessly, just like a jazz musician caught up in the excitement of spontaneous creation.""  I love this description, and I think it is spot on.<br /><br />The writing, which goes from straightforward to lyrical, to manic, to commonplace, and back again, is really wonderful, and really beat.  The writing's spirit and energy drive this book, as the book's lead character, Sal Paradise, travels back and forth across the country, often accompanied with his friend, Dean.  They travel, explore new places, meet new people and develop relationships, listen to music, explore drugs, and talk about their lives.  This book is about the characters, their spirit, their yearnings, and their wanderings.  It's about life.

B005NAUKAC;0;B005NAUKAC;5.0;Sometimes I think we (ok, me!) buy 'how to write' books to avoid actually writing. But not this time. I cannot recommend this one highly enough. I did (or tried to do, not always successful as I'm ME) everything the author suggested and I found an incredible portal though which my writing passed into being better, easier and more prolific.<br />I had tried very basic uninformed outlining with my YA series - before that I pantsed everything, which was fine for a memoir and two highly autobiographical novels. But then I wanted to really write, invent, in 3rd person POV fiction. And I kept hitting walls.<br />The outline methods in this book changing my thinking, my plotting schema. It was fun, it took the heavy lifting out of the actual writing process, and allowed me to really think through possible scenarios in outline form. And then the big winner. Have written detailed outlines (which also works superbly for building worlds, character formation, setting, voice) I found I'd sit down and be able to WRITE A WHOLE LOT MORE.

It appears that if you work for state government you are one of the good guys, but take a federal job and you automatically become an out of control, immoral, or stupid person (BTW, how would a 20-year old researcher know more about Grizzly behavior than a warden with 20+ years of experience?). Box obviously dislikes elected government or federal employees, but those &quot;secret&quot; Feds working off the reservation behind the scenes are OK? Joe's increasing willingness to go beyond his authority and keep secrets (to avoid paying insurance?) undermines his credibility, and he becomes less of a good guy with every adventure. Box writes well when describing Wyoming, but the plots and explanations get more and more bizarre. Student volunteer working on EMP devices on weekends and go home and apparently do not say a word to anyone? Joe's daughter witnesses multiple killing and a savage beheadings, and apparently only needs to get a new roommate to get over it? And a fellow warden is depicted as a porno-packing womanizer who is killed trying to find Joe, and no mention of how this was resolved is made? In all honesty, by the end of the book I was skimming to get through it and may have missed it). I am a Wyoming native, and the death of a warden would be a BIG deal. I closed another review on another Pickett adventure that started to bother me for similar reasons with the same request--say it ain't so, Joe--get back to being a father and warden (number 21 as I remember) and leave the political and 007 stuff to others.

Like his friend told him, Rusty's attacked by a wild cat, but when Rusty fights back, him and the attacker, Graypaw, become close friends.  But when Graypaws Clan leader offers Rusty one day to decide if he wants to join the clan, he has one day to choose between his safe, boring life he grew up with his best friends and caring housefolk, or the deadly life he's always wanted with adventure and freedom at every turn.<br /><br /> Eventually, the Warriors series makes a large Text-to-World connection, but I won't spoil it for you.  It's mostly Text-to-Text.  Each book having a connection to the one before, if it's a fight like a previous one, or there's a tragic story, just like the one before.  But no two books have the exact same plot.  It's always a new story, new adventure, even if it seams the same.<br /><br /> The audience for ""Warriors: Into the Wild"" is between 9 and 13 year olds.  Although other ages might enjoy the book too.  Any cat fan should read the books if they have ever wondered what cats might think from day to day.  The audience stays the same throughout all Warriors books so you'll never be disappointed.

She has such insight and empathy for her characters, and is also wickedly funny.<br /><br />Sir Edward Feathers, a retired and elderly judge, is from all appearances a man who has lived an uneventful life and been smiled on by fortune - or so his colleagues apparently believe. We are taken back to his earliest days in Malaysia, where we look in at a little boy happily playing in the mud, not knowing the English language, and living an uncomplicated life. He is soon wrenched away, sent to a foster family in England and we then peek in on his life at various stages.<br /><br />It's heart-wrenching to see the pain inflicted on the little boy in his new circumstances, all the more painful as we have seen his innocence and delight in his former life. We witness the effect this pain - as well as the casual indifference of other adults who should have cared for him - had on his sense of self. He is shown kindness by his headmaster, ""Sir"", and I believe he would have been lost if not for it. We end up with a rich portrait of Edward Feathers - with each glimpse into his life another nuance is added. The story of his journey from childhood into old age is powerful and moving, and the juxtaposition of the small boy playing in the Malaysian mud, innocent of the hurt that people can inflict, and the ""spectacularly clean"" and proper judge soldiering on into old age will stay with you.";1158992502000;Rich and  moving portrait;AETXW4DKTQDBNEQZ5STCYIJHOLFA;False
1934695238;1;1934695238;5.0;"Meitner's third book is divided into 3 sections. The topics are broad, but they all, in some way, relate to being female, from adolescence into adulthood, and they celebrate female sexuality. Her writing is tight, precise, humorous, and delightful. The girls are vigilant in a dangerous world; sometimes the danger is specific and physical, sometimes emotional.<br /><br />The first section is my favorite. Titled makeshift instructions for vigilant girls, this section is composed of poems about puberty and the angst of adolescence.<br />How I long for erasure, a third eye<br />to beam me from the stage where I sit,<br />passive, off-kilter, knees together,<br />hands folded neatly in my lap.<br />(Smile! It's School Picture Time)<br /><br />The 2 ½ page poem ""Sex Ed"" captures the discomfort of sitting through the videos and lectures, and the cynicism of teens. The sneer at the teacher echoes through lines like these:<br /> Sex as anything but get-lost-in-it<br />pleasure, ephemeral treasure-chest<br />of orgasm, a word Mrs. Callaghan<br />has managed to avoid all semester-<br /><br /> You can hear the classic teenage sigh as the sexually experienced teens watch the boy in the video fumble:<br />Someone needs to raise their hand immediately<br />and volunteer to tell the girl ion the car<br />to unbutton her blouse for that guy slowly.<br /><br />The theme of danger and warning continues in the second section, contact notes, which contains several poems about alien abduction.

These poems aren't as immediate and in-your-face as the ones in the first section, but there are still warnings. The danger here is complacency and boredom. ""Engagement"" opens with these lines:<br />Love colored with sidewalk chalk<br />won't make it through the next rain.<br /><br />Do you feel relief like bus exhaust? Nothing<br />at all? When he calls do you make grocery lists<br />(The Night Before the Wedding)<br /><br />Meitner uses strong imagery and metaphor. She injects wry humor into much of her work.

1442430362;1;1442430362;4.0;This book reminded me of Disney movies.  It was full of moments that could have been scripted for a T.V film.  There was a familiarity to the story line that reminded me of a couple of films, 'Ice Princess' and another Disney movie, 'Go Figure' They both dealt with ice-skaters and 'Go Figure' had both an ice-skater and a ice hockey team as well, only the plot with 'Bittersweet' is definitely different in this case.<br /><br />'Bittersweet' is a kind of feel-good book, even though the main character, Hudson, is going through the worst moments of her young life.  Funnily enough, she hides her pain in cupcakes.  I really liked how this story progressed.  It took me from the incident that made Hudson turn her back on everything she knew, to Hudson finally realizing what made her happy.  I enjoyed her persona and even felt a little sorry for her mother seemed to hassle her.<br /><br />The other characters in this book was good too - including an adorable love interest in Josh.  The relationships between the characters felt real.  It was also hard to see how some of the friendships changed and evolved as I was reading.  I was annoyed, angry and a little sad at how Hudson was with some of them.  But, at the same time, I also resented Hudson's mom a bit, even though I came to understand why she was that way.<br /><br />The writing was fun and flowed nicely.  This is the type of book to read if you've just finished a book that was intense or if you just want to relax after a hard day where you don't really want to think about anything.<br /><br />So it's fair to say that even though I don't have anything really bad to say about 'Bittersweet', it didn't have the 'oomph' that made me fall in love with it.  I didn't go on to remember anything about it, except that Hudson made cupcakes and she was an ice-skater.  That being said though, I did like it and I would read it again if I had the option.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who likes Disney films or is looking for a light read.;1372028282000;Fluffy light read;AHVHAHRVMRS6YGUBEGXDO72QT3VQ;False
0764209671;1;0764209671;5.0;Karen Witemeyer does it again with Full Steam Ahead. This is her newest book and I've found it to be her best so far. The writing is quick and witty and the story is very well rounded out and put together.<br /><br />Full Steam Ahead is an engaging story about the feisty Nicole Renard who in an effort to find an heir for her ailing father's shipping company sets off for New Orleans to find a husband. Events however send her off course to a little town in Texas where she must find a way to earn enough money to make her way to New Orleans. Fortunately she finds work for Darius Thornton a man obsessed with finding a way to make travel on steamships safer. He is an unconventional scientist who has little time for anything other than his experiments, let alone love, and  just may turn out to be the perfect man Nicole set out to find in the first place.<br /><br />As always Karen Witemeyer is a very creative and cleaver author. Her writing flows well throughout the story and there were no major plot holes in the story. Full Steam Ahead wasn't as funny as some of her other books but it still had moments where I found myself giggling at a paragraph or conversation going on in the book.<br /><br />Karen Witemeyer's books may be romance's but they are never dull. She always manages to add suspense and danger in her books and her latest is no exception. After reading the summary I was expecting the Jenkins brothers to show up more often than they did, but after meeting them I'm glad that expectation wasn't fulfilled. They are great villains who cause more than their fair share of trouble for both Nicole and Darius. I found myself on the edge of my seat often, eager to see how things would turn out.<br /><br />From the main characters to the one's who only show up once or twice all of the people who show up in this book are very well written. Nicole and Darius were both very endearing with personalities that made me like them instantly. Their successes and flaws were well rounded and I never found just one thing about either of them overpowering. The minor characters were all very delightful as well. I would have liked to have seen a little more of Nicole's parents, because they seemed like they could have added quite a bit to the story, but I also understand why they were absent for most of the story.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about Karen's books is the spiritual aspect of them. Her books always deal with issues or questions Christians face daily and she always does a great job writing about these things. Full Steam Ahead was no different. I found myself moved as I read about how Darius struggled with forgiving himself for the Louisiana steam boat accident and inspired when Nicole helped him to see through his struggle and rely on God's love, forgiveness, and grace. This book has come at a moment where I needed to read the words that Nicole told Darius almost as much as he did and I hope that they have a similar effect on others who read Full Steam Ahead.<br /><br />There are however a few things that I didn't like while reading through the book. About halfway through the book the romance began to really build and heat up, which was good. What wasn't was the fact that Darius' personality seemed to change almost instantly. There are a few events that push this happening, but I felt that he lost a little too much of his personality in his sudden rush of emotion for Nicole. He was still Darius, there was just something missing. Another thing that is nagging at me is the fact that closer to the end a lot of effort is put into letting the reader know about a ring, this ring does show up, but it is immediatly forgotten and never brought up again in the book. This isn't a major issue, but it would have been nice to have a final mention of it somewhere at the end.<br /><br />Full Steam Ahead was an excellent read, one that I would read again. It's historical setting is lush and beautiful and well written. It will lift your spirits and hopefully inspire you to trust in God a little more. I give it 5 out of 5 stars and would most certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a good historical read, romance, inspirational book, or all of the above.<br /><br />Note: I received a free copy of this book from NetGalley for my fair and honest review which I have stated above.;1401138713000;Karen Witemeyer Does It Again;AFDN3TJR4SWZ7VIKB6PQXLESGBVQ;False

Everything is, and is not, itself.  The visible & invisible layers clamp like dew to each other, then unfasten like strings from garments, like blood from the body, and then-always then, suddenly, without warning-flood one another with meaning[s], are both indivisible and ethereal, interconnected and isolated.

1416939172;0;1416939172;3.0;"Unfortunately, Claim to Fame wasn't one of my favorite Haddix books to date. The premise sounded really interesting, hence why I requested it, but it ended up feeling a bit odd and not like the likable but also really intriguing middle grade books she has written in the past.<br /><br />A famous child star, Lindsay Scott's ""claim to fame"" isn't all that great for her unfortunately.  When she was eleven she had a nervous breakdown and has been living in isolation with her father ever since. What really happened however is that a power manifested itself in Lindsay and now she can hear what everyone is saying. This is not a gift at all, especially for a celebrity who is already in the spotlight. After her father's death however, things change again when Lindsay is kidnapped.<br /><br />I recommend Margaret Peterson Haddix's books all the time to the middle grade readers in my community. She usually has such a deft touch with the middle school age group, writing ideas and content they can relate to, all wrapped up in an interesting and mysterious storyline. Claim to Fame began on a good note but I got lost in some of the ideas and theories Haddix was throwing in, ideas that I don't think many tweens are going to find that interesting or have much understanding of. While the writing is still very high quality, I didn't feel as if it was truly speaking to the audience the way her ideas and themes have in previous books.<br /><br />This is not a bad book. Even a subpar Margaret Peterson Haddix title is still on the whole, much better written than many middle grade books. However, I can't see myself using this book as easily in a book talk or book conversation with the middle graders at my library. I think fans of her book will pick this up regardless because it does have her name on the cover, but that cannot be the highest recommendation to a book unfortunately. If you're a big fan of Haddix, I say rent this one from the library.";1269551941000;Claim to Fame doesn't quite pull you in.;AGWLQKXEU32VUOS3LP4DAIORTTQA;False

Thus  he had more to say about his general fitlessness, in-town layovers, trail  history, bears and flora, and day hikes. However, as much as I regret he  and Katz--bumbling twinkies, littering the trial with excess equipment,  cigarette butts, and not even finishing the last hundred to  Katahdin--cheated themselves of the full experience of the trail, I admit  that Bryson described a few essential, even typical moments. His wit and  self-deprecating narrative made me smile and remember my own long travail.  But I felt cheated because I wanted him to describe how he would have felt  on Rainbow Ledges seeing Mt.

The book has three main sections, looking at inequality within nations, between nations, and between all the world's people. The numbers are eye-opening, and I started feeling extremely fortunate to have picked the right parents and country to be born into (America).<br />My greatest disappointment is that the book is so weak on conclusions: if over 80 percent of your income is determined by your place of birth and the income of your parents, and a good portion of the rest can be chalked up to gender, race, age, and luck, only the tiniest percent is due to personal sacrifice and effort; therefore, few of us really deserve the incomes we are basically born into, and since those born in Ethiopia or Bangladesh are at least as unlucky to be born there, through no fault or lack of effort on their part, we ought to be doing more for the poor countries. He raises the issues of migration from poor to rich countries, and how the rich countries are fighting back; walls aren't the answer, and neither is globalization. Investment in the poorer nations, to build local economies around what they can do best, and keep their youth employed at home, is a far better answer. He discusses the failure of communism and socialism and how innovation, hard work and entrepreurship were disincentivised by the state, yet there is no discussion of the shortcomings of capitalism and what our current economies might learn from these failures.<br />All in all, a good book, which lets you draw your own conclusions, but I think, like the philosopher Peter Singer, that you need to spell out explicity the lessons people should draw from the data.";1520991325673;Great data and explanations, even if it doesn't reach strong ethical conclusions;AHF4BYPOX76RDU3TWI2KDJVTHR5A;False

The only exceptions to this are the dozens of small stories of small people, none of which add much to the narrative.  On the other hand, the author skims over the ""Revolution of 1919"".  From reading the book you'd have no idea what happened during this period.  Nevertheless, if you're looking for a history of that period in Germany, and how Hitler came to power, this is a good resource.<br /><br />One issue I have with the book is the author's characterization of the Nazis and any nationalist org as ""right wing"" or ""conservative"".  There have been plenty of left-wing nationalist parties over the years - in Russia, China, Vietnam, and Cambodia, for example.  There have been plenty of left-wing racists - Margaret Sanger, Harold Laski, H.G. Wells, George Bernard Shaw, and William Beveridge, to name a few.  Just because the Nazis were violently opposed to Communism doesn't make them right-wing.  The Menscheviks were opposed to the Bolsheviks, yet all that made them was a competing left-wing group.  The Nazis were classically left-wing - they wanted to mobilize every aspect of society to serve the state, they intruded into every nook and crannie of life, they were an extreme perversion of the Progressivism of the era.  By my own and many others' commonly understood definition of ""right-wing"" as being in favor of minimal government and maximum individual liberty, Nazism is just another radical, murderous left-wing ideology.<br /><br />But then I realized that author Richard Evans is probably a left winger himself, so he consciously or unconsciously had to characterize the Nazis as right-wing.  The tip-off was when he wrote that the Nazis' brutality and torture in 1933 didn't compared to the more syste<br /><br />Listening to the sequel to this book, ""The Third Reich in Power"", I hear the author continue his confusion about the spectrum of politics.

How about Stalin and then Beria's Soviet Union, Pol Pot's Cambodia, Mao's China, Fidel and Che's Cuba, or any other Communist dictatorship over the past 100 years?  Are Argentina, Chile, and Greece really the apogee of systematized torture?<br /><br />In the final few pages of the sequel, Evans again explicitly acknowledges that Nazism was not a ""conservative"" political movement or philosophy, but rather ""modernist"".  He writes, ""there was no going back"" in the nazi agenda, but rather abandoning conservative practices in favor or entirely new, ""totalitarianism"".<br /><br />If you can ignore the constant references to ""extreme right-wing"" Nazis, and if you haven't already read or studied this period in Germany, this can be a useful book.";1370887493000;"Good Survey of Period, But Mis-Use of ""Right Wing""";AHEX3HC3ZBC74O36D4APF724EAHA;False
1250110254;0;1250110254;2.0;This type of book is right up my alley, but I never connected with any of the main characters.  It was also completely joyless.  I understand that the author was making a lot of points and trying to keep with overarching themes, etc. but her dedication to those themes seemed to make her think she could not allow any joyful moments into the narrative.  The most appealing characters were Moss, Reg and Len but in the end they were used to make a point and weren't ever fully developed.  To be fair, the author has a lovely writing style and is clearly talented, but I would not recommend.

0310212685;0;0310212685;4.0;"Informationally, this book provides an excellent cross-section of the differing contemporary views on hell. In format, each writer is given a portion of the book to present their defense, most giving the historical development of their thesis, as well as a modern day look and support of their beliefs. Afterwards, the remaining three authors are given a chance to refute the claims in light of their own views. In this way, all of the authors are represented fairly and equally. One of the views presented is actually a comentary on Purgatory, the Catholic view of the transitionary period between death and hell, and is not actually the Catholic view on hell itself. However, the three other reviews offer a defense of their individual views and provide ample support for each one. The only issue that I had with this book is that there is no conclusive chapter or any sort of ""wrap it up"" information at the culmination of the book. Although, for someone who is seeking information to make their own decision, this book leaves it completely up to the individual to make any conclusion, I felt that perhaps some sort of guidance at the end of the book would have been helpful.

0525423281;1;0525423281;4.0;"A sweet, and touching story, and a very worthy successor to Ana and the French Kiss!<br /><br />~ Premise ~<br /><br />Its summer and Lola's greatest ambitions for her time consist of spending time with her rock star boyfriend and creating a magnificent Marie Antoinette costume for the winter formal.  Things start going awry for her when her childhood sweetheart moves back into the neighborhood.  Old passions clash with new, making Lola who her heart really needs.<br /><br />~ Characters ~<br /><br />Lola: Lola is a different sort of heroine than Ana.  She's quirky, loud, and spunky, with a temper and a sarcastic wit.  Not really mind favorite type of female heroine, but it's hard not to like her.  She's an amateur fashion designer with her own sense of style. For her every day like Halloween - dressing in costumes with wigs, tiaras, big boots, and tons of color.  She's a good student, and a loyal friend.  She also has a bad tendency to lie and hide things from people she cares about which will make you want to smack her at times.<br /><br />Max: Lola's boyfriend - he's 22, and a rockstar.  Lola's ""dads"" have agreed to let her date him but have imposed a ton of rules to ensure she remains as protected as possible.  He's seems to really appreciate Lola, but shows zero interest in her friends, her family, or really anything that matters to her, which makes us question the sincerity of his feeling for her.<br /><br />Cricket:  The boy that got away.  He's an inventor, shy, sweet, geeky, and often overlooked by the people in his life. Cricket and Lola grew up together - neighbors from the time they were little children.  He was her first kiss - at the ripe age of seven, and the first person she fell in love with in junior highschool.  He's also the first person that broke her heart.<br /><br />~ Romance ~<br /><br />Sugary sweet - this love could seriously give you a tooth ache.  But it's not an unrealistic kind of sweet.  Rather it's the sweet that comes from a story where the good guy really does get the girl.  I loved Cricket - he's my kind of guy. He's sweet, loyal, honest, and awkward.  You can't help but root for him, even though you don't understand in the beginning why he hurt Lola so much.  I'd have enjoyed this romance all the more if Lola was more my kind of female heroine.  She's just a bit too brash for me.  That being said, there are still plenty of swoon-worthy moments to be had in this book.<br /><br />~ My thoughts ~<br /><br />I found this story to be in turns sweet and touching.  It's a young adult drama, so don't expect tons of action.  What keeps you turning the pages here are the character relationships, and the romance that builds between Lola and Cricket.<br /><br />I'd be hard pressed to say which book I liked better - Ana or Lola.  I identified more with Ana as a character, but the romance in this book was perhaps even better than what we found in Ana.  There were less ups and downs - breakups and misunderstandings. And I think there was more wisdom hidden within its pages on the nature of relationships and what really matters in them.<br /><br />In the pages of this book we travel with Lola as she grows up, and learns to both understand and accept herself.  We learn importance of honesty in relationships, we most vitally we learn what real love looks like.  That love should be full of natural magic, it's not always easy, but it should flow.  That it's a person's imperfections that make them perfect for one another.<br /><br />So if you are in the mood for another sweet romance in the vein of Ana and the French Kiss, this book will sate your need quite nicely.";1317679410000;Delightful little romance story;AGJLB3P3Z4EELWHZBYULUSI2T7EQ;True

1595230203;10;1595230203;3.0;"I'm not a big fan of the United Nations to begin with but I find Eric Shawn's book The U.N. Exposed to be less than impressive.  The entire book revolves around the ""Oil for Food"" scandal.  Mr. Shawn nit picks the U.N.'s administrative problems like how they hire people (it's not what you know, it's who you know) and that leads to many under qualified individuals.  The ""U.N. World"" as he puts it, creates an aura of rich ambassadors who take advantage of New York's generosity economically and by backstabbing the United States by vetoing resolutions we favor.  He goes on to mention U.N. peace keepers that have violated women, how the U.N. funds terrorism, and how they constantly ask the biggest contributor to the U.N. (United States) for more money.  I would agree with all that he states but Mr. Shawn really is making a point that the U.N. should really be titled ""The United States United Nations.""  After all, we fund 22 percent of the U.N. budget and 27 percent of the peace keeping operations and billions more in U.N. agencies yet most countries in the U.N. votes against us.

142239087X;2;142239087X;5.0;This collection of eight short stories conveys some of the heartaches, challenges, and joys experienced by Chinese immigrants to North America during the nineteenth century. These immigrants, often impoverished peasants in China who wanted to support their families, had left for the New World attracted by the promise of plentiful job opportunities.  They came to the United States and Canada to search for gold during the gold rushes, help build the transcontinental railroads, work in primary industries such as farming and lumbering, and find odd jobs wherever there might be an opening.<br /><br /> Adding to the difficult nature of much of this work, Chinese immigrants often faced blatant discrimination and hostility from North American whites. Both countries passed laws restricting Chinese immigration, many Chinese lived segregated lives in Chinatowns, and Chinese workers often experienced more dangerous work conditions and lower pay than their white counterparts.  These struggles led to some painful legacies, which for some were counterbalanced by happier times of prosperity, growing families, and new opportunities.<br /><br /> Paul Yee's short stories masterfully communicate these sorrows and hopes, with carefully-crafted prose and surprising conclusions that keep the pages turning.  With its excellent writing and deeply symbolic illustrations, this book is highly recommended.;1312563145000;Rutgers University Project on Economics and Children;AGNCYYFCGN6T6CM4JYSIWX72FKEA;False

1887840826;5;1887840826;4.0;This story takes place in a fictional kingdom during the Middle Ages. Trad is a ten-year-old boy who has lived most of his life with his abusive grandfather. He barely remembers his parents, who died in a plague when he was only four. This grandfather consorts with robbers and evil men. Trad often pretends to be stupid to avoid their notice and warns travelers away from their territory. One day, he rescues a man who has been badly wounded and cares for him in a secret cave. This man, whose white hair makes him seem elderly, insists that he is on a mission, a great and terrible quest . . . but because of a head wound, he can't remember what his quest is. All that he knows is that time is short, and he does not have long to complete his quest to find something very important. Trad soon learns that his grandfather's wicked friends are the ones who attacked this mysterious stranger. Taking his father's old lute, a couple of coins, and a mysterious ring dropped by one of the robbers which seems to have once belonged to the stranger. Together, Trad and the stranger embark on a journey across the land, making friends and pursued by enemies as they go. While the stranger struggles to remember his identity and the nature of his mission, Trad begins to learn a few things about his own forgotten past and the nature of his family. Nothing is what it seems. Their country is in trouble because of the evil men who have been controlling it. Everything depends on the success of the stranger's mission, and Trad has a much larger role to play than he had ever dreamed.<br /><br />It's a beautiful and fascinating story about good and evil, loyalty, friendship, and determination to do the right thing, even against the odds. There are parts that might frighten younger readers. The fights are violent and bloody, and there are a couple instances of cruelty to animals (partly, it seems, to show how truly evil Trad's enemies are). Still, it's a great story for tweens and teens, and readers will want to cheer Trad on as he struggles to help those around him and find his own destiny.;1331010053000;Join the Quest!;AGTNAABRNREEZFTBR3RPW3GZ2MMA;False

It is about a man that caused the  deaths of over 200,000 people, and 47 American's who were being held  prisoner in the city when the bomb was dropped. I just think that calling  someone who did that a hero is a bit dangerous. Greene also suggests that  this violent act &quot;won the war&quot;, when practically every military  scholar who has looked at this has said that the war was already over,  Japan only wanted an honorable end to it. This book is not about heroism it  is about revenge, and the tragedy of &quot;just following orders&quot;.  This incident is no different from what happened in Germany, Italy or even  Japan in WWII. All were just following orders and the most horrible  slaughter the world has ever known was the result.

It's not every day I feel excited to recommend a book to friends, students and associates, but this book is something all women can relate to in multifaceted ways. She writes with a lot of energy and she comes off sexy, though she tells us she wasn't always that way. This book is about her unveiling and our own! She tells it how it is, and I like that.<br /><br />She makes me think hard; Chapter 1; What do women really want? She uses a Canterbury Tale, ""The Woman of Bath"" to more than suggest women want dominion over men?"". I don't think most women would even admit that to themselves but it's worth your time to contemplate.<br />Even though I'm familiar with much of what she says because I'm a long time belly dance instructor with similar slant; belly dance is more than a dance on a stage; but there is a great deal of new insights I find provocative. She has my ear. Her voice is intelligent and the contents is well written and excellently laid out. Bravo!<br /><br />This book is also a rich resource for citations of women's psychology through and through. I will definitely refer back to it often. She pulls from these combined works and leads the reader into a fuller and useful understanding as we journey through the chapters and apply our wisdom to the  ""personal path workings"" journal exercises at the end of each chapter. I haven't done all of them because frankly I'm eager to read the following chapters. However I tell myself I will definitely  re read this book and apply more of these exercises. The author introduces the reader to a collection of real women from all walks of life and to female archetypes in the form of Goddesses, storybook characters, religious icons. . . All of them experiencing and expressing life, dancing, growing and shifting states.<br /><br /> Personally I'm coming away with a illuminated acceptance of why, while I'm a successful woman I have not had the fever for corporate acceleration. I'm not made of that stuff and there is no need to apologize. I have chosen to be a mother, a lover, a nurturer and an artist and well I should. To help others does give my life purpose, and it's inborn in the feminine.

0061537934;1;0061537934;5.0;"""The Art of Racing in the Rain"" is the story of the life of Enzo, a lab mix with the mind of a philosopher and the heart of a human.  The story is written from Enzo's point of view, and through his eyes we watch as his owner Denny, lives his life.  Enzo, Denny's faithful companion, is present when Denny falls in love with Eve, and watches as they get married and start a family.  We feel Enzo's joy when Zoe is born, and we feel his love and protectiveness as he lives each day with his family.  Seeing through Enzo's eyes, we witness scenes and gain insight that others in the story do not have -- who worries about what they do or say in front of a dog? -- but we also experience his limitations; Enzo can not grasp things, turn doorknobs, or, no matter how much he wants to, speak.  We also watch, feeling Enzo's helplessness, as Eve becomes ill then unexpectedly dies, plunging Denny into a three-year custody battle over Zoe with Eve's parents.<br /><br />Stein does an excellent job of crafting the narration and description to reflect not only Enzo's intelligence and soul, but also his inherent ""dogness"".  Stein's work is quite original in this regard, and his prose has a fullness of development and fluidity that gives Enzo a necessary, believable realism.  Enzo's character is very well developed and three dimensional, which contrasts with the flatness of the other characters.  However, the flatness is appropriate, given the relationship between Enzo and everyone else.  The flatness reflects the mostly one-way relationship between Enzo and others. It reflects the limitations of what Enzo can see and know about them.<br /><br />There are strong themes of loyalty, determination, and hope despite seemingly overwhelming odds running throughout the book.  And the details and discussion about racing and how the principles of racing can give insight into a way to live one's life is a nice counterpoint to the main thrust of the plot.  The book also suggests interesting possibilities about the intelligence of dogs.  It will make you take a second look at your dog and wonder just how much he or she does understand about your life.<br /><br />All in all, a wonderful read. If you have a dog, or even if you don't, I recommend that you read this book. It is inspiring.";1234739488000;Heart Warming, Heart Wrenching, and Unforgetable;AG7EXDU5RGJMAZ5RGCYYBYPRW5YA;False

Lescroart has relied less heavily on Hardy over his last few novels, but he remains adept at creating characters you care about, characters who ring true. I liked Wyatt Hunt in The Hunt Club and Treasure Hunt. But with this novel, Hunt threatens to replace Hardy as Lescroart's most interesting character.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong; he's not there yet. But a couple of efforts as strong as this one, and he will be.<br /><br />In The Hunter, Wyatt Hunt is sent on a journey of personal discovery by an anonymous text message questioning his mother's fate. He discovers a 40-year-old mystery with profound personal implications: His mother was murdered, and his father was the chief suspect. The texter believes Hunt's father was innocent. But if he wasn't the killer, who was? Hunt finds the answer, but at great cost.<br /><br />I read this on my Kindle in two days. I found the story, characters, settings and dialogue quite compelling. A knowledge of Lescroart's previous novels would help the reader to understand some background, especially with regard to the characters Devin Juhle and Tamara. But there's enough explanation within this novel that a newcomer to Lescroart would have very little trouble keeping up. [The one exception: The resolution of Hunt's relationship with Gina Roake seems superfluous and unnecessary if you don't know how they've progressed in previous novels].<br /><br />Highly recommended, overall.";1367528494000;Compelling and well done;AH76XKHSYFZVHLTDX2WB3IN6FCUA;True

0060916575;34;0060916575;1.0;"In this startling book, Paul Johnson claims to find fault with the work of many famous writers because, he says, their personal behaviour was less honourable than the ideas they created, developed or otherwise espoused.  Well, gee, Paul, that's an interesting tactic.  On that basis, Christianity is to be despised because Jesus was rude to his mother (or because He felt that His father, who after all ran the show, wasn't there when He needed Him.)<br />Or you could take the same argument and reverse-engineer it, as it were.  You could say that, because Adolf Hitler was kind to animals and scrupulously courteous to women, that therefore Nazism can't have been such a terrible thing after all.  OK, granted that Hitler took a while to marry Eva Braun, so he was a bit of a cad about that, not to mention that nasty business with Geli Raubal.  But Josef Goebbels and Hermann Goering were happy family men, weren't they?  Not to mention Rudolf Hoess, the commandant of Auschwitz during its period of greatest expansion.  All great believers in hearth and home.  It really clears things up when you look at it that way, doesn't it?<br />One curious fact about this, as I say, startling book is that a striking number of the Intellectuals here displayed with their moral pants down are, goodness me, left-wing intellectuals.  In fact, there's scarcely a conservative to be seen.  Hmmm.  It does rather make you wonder about Winston Churchill, who was a lifelong Tory who, yes, helped to save Britain during the Second World War (for which I am grateful to him, seeing as my mother lived through the same) but who also happened to believe that Arabs were inferior races who didn't deserve to be treated as human.  He also drank like a fish.  Blimey.  And yet Paul had made everything seem so clear.  Now I don't know _what_ to think!<br />The thing about this book that - now that I've mentioned it - is actually startling, is that such an asinine, transparently foolish thesis got as far as being taken seriously by a publisher in the first place.  Johnson is a right-wing bigot whose intelligence has long been corroded by his inability to appreciate any idea that refuses to serve naked power.  Incapable of refuting the arguments of Marx, Rousseau and anybody else he disagrees with, he footlingly attempts to play the man instead of the ball by discrediting the personal lives of better thinkers than him.  Thankfully for the rest of us, Christopher Hitchens beat him at his own game years ago, in a review of this book that told some stories about Johnson's own personal behaviour that it would be impolitic to repeat here (though you can read them yourself in Hitchens' collection ""Prepared for the Worst"".)  In the meantime, this is the usual collection of sloppy invective, gasbag harrumphing and hawkish platitudes that Johnson-watchers have learned to expect.<br />I don't believe that there's a single ""intellectual"", of any stripe, from Gandhi to Stalin via Noam Chomsky and Norman Podhoretz, who hasn't done something that even their most faithful admirers couldn't find objectionable.  Thing is, Paul, ideas have a life of their own.  It doesn't matter a jot that the person who first had the idea farted in bed or borrowed a lot of money.  A good idea is a good idea, and part of the responsibility of being an intellectual is to sort out the good ideas from the bad - and, in so doing, to determine the truth.<br />Think how many birds might have found perfectly good nests in the trees that were chopped down to print this drivel.

0374118582;9;0374118582;2.0;Someone must have told Davis that since she was exceptionally brilliant she must write down her every observation, thought, and dream. I may be strange, but I think anything literary should amuse, thrill, inform, or intrigue. This work seems a collection of insipid lists and random, meaningless details. Perhaps readers with artistic leanings or those searching for the very unusual will detect a perfect construct while I behold only banality.<br /><br />Examples: One nearly blank page with the title, “Her Geography: Illinois” and the message, “She knows she is in Chicago. But she does not yet realize that she is in Illinois.” A seven-page list of little annoyances, including, “I’m tired.” “My thumb hurts.” “The shower is weak.” Sixteen pages, count them, observing three cows in a field. I confess that after starting this description of slow wandering domestic animals and their perceived emotions, I uttered, I can’t and won’t read all sixteen pages.<br /><br />Perhaps inspired by her surroundings, the author composes five pages, translating in-home sounds into words: “The washing machine in spin cycle: ‘Pakistani, Pakistani.’” “A spoon stirring yeast in a bowl: ‘Unilateral, unilateral.’” “Sneeze: ‘At issue.’” I’m not making this up!<br /><br />Among this variety of prose, there are some entertaining paragraphs. Such as the irony in “Odon von Horvath Out Walking” where the titled subject, while hiking in the Alps, discovers a skeleton and in the corpse’s backpack finds a picture postcard, ready to send, that reads, “Having a wonderful time.”<br /><br />Davis reflects my impressions of this book where she writes of reading a book that she is no longer interested in: “Please spare me your imagination, I’m so tired of your vivid imagination, let someone else enjoy it.”;1426789899000;BORING!;AFIKHQGQXLCCQWY3MF3UGATGSMVQ;True

0802119409;17;0802119409;5.0;"Dear Mr. Beauclerk:<br /><br />Congratulations on your magnificent book, Shakespeare's Lost Kingdom. It will forever change the study of Shakespeare and Elizabethan history.<br /><br />The book is a sterling act of courage for an author, your editors and your publisher Grove Press. The book forever throws open the door because it is ""The True History of Shakespeare and Elizabeth.""<br /><br />Your book will provoke hysteria among the academics and historians. Nevertheless, for decades, if not centuries, they have remained ossified behind the myth of the Virgin Queen and the humble Bard of Stratford-upon-Avon. Your book is an unvarnished telling of dramatic, overwhelming and sometimes repellant truths.<br /><br />First, that Queen Elizabeth was no Virgin Queen but had a child with Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford (one of her several children), who was raised as Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton. As you clearly indicate, that explains the meaning of the dedication of Venus and Adonis to the young earl by ""William Shakespeare.""<br /><br />Second, you give more than enough evidence to convince anyone that Edward de Vere was the hidden child of Queen Elizabeth, born in 1548. Then, you seem to equivocate on the matter. ""If Elizabeth did give birth, it most likely was in September (1548), or ""for if Oxford was a changeling, as some have claimed, born up to eighteen months earlier.""<br /><br />My book, Oxford: Son of Queen Elizabeth I (Oxford Institute Press, 2001), states that Oxford was born on July 21, 1548 in Cheshunt, England. His putative father, John de Vere, was forced into a marriage with, Margery Golding, at Belchamp, on August 1, 1548. Shortly, thereafter, Elizabeth writes a note to William Cecil calling him her ""friend."" The evidence is overwhelming that the changeling was placed in the household of John de Vere, and raised as Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford. My findings strongly support your central conclusions.  [[ASIN:0971349800 Oxford: Son of Queen Elizabeth I]]<br /><br />Further, after Elizabeth became Queen she attended the commencements of the young Oxford from Cambridge in August 1564 and Oxford in 1566. Surely, these were signs of maternal affection for her son.<br />However, if both points are true, then that brings the world to the most uncomfortable conclusion that Queen Elizabeth I had an incestuous relationship with her son.<br /><br />As difficult as that conclusion is, it remains the truth. Neither you nor anyone else is responsible for justifying or explaining the truth, only for telling such.<br /><br />Finally, if Elizabeth and Oxford had a child, are there descendants down to the present day?  My work clearly shows that there is a legitimate Tudor line down to the present and therefore a Tudor pretender to the throne. Small details.<br /><br />Shakespeare's Lost Kingdom is a literary landmark.<br /><br />With sincere appreciation,<br /><br />Paul Streitz";1269617174000;A Literary Landmark;AGH3NFQERCP4HSO522VN3UW2L3TA;True

1780995725;16;1780995725;4.0;"Melusine Draco’s latest book By Wolfsbane & Mandrake Root: The Shadow World Of Plants And Their Poisons is a great introduction into the world of baneful plants. I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about this subject. Coming in at only 96 pages, the book is brief and to the point. She starts the book off by giving a fairly thorough introduction into the historical, mythological and fictional worlds of poisons. This section is full of interesting information; from political assassinations, the Gospel of Aradia, Shakespeare, J.K. Rowling, women poisoning their husbands, the flying ointment of witches and much more. As a traditional witch she places emphasis on the connection of poisons with that of witchcraft, sorcery and cunning folk traditions.<br /><br />The second part of the book discusses historical methods of detecting poison and trying to counteract it. The information about how people would use stones to detect poisons was really interesting. Some gemstones were believed to neutralize poisons and were placed on the goblets of Royalty as a protective measure. Other stones were believed to ward off poisoning just by wearing them or having them on your person. Certain imagery and amulets as well as prayers and incantations were also used to help ward off poisoning. The historical use herbs to combat poisoning is also examined - most being herbs that induce vomiting.<br /><br />The third section of the book is a very well researched encyclopedic list of baneful plants and fungi including every day plants and herbs around us that aren’t normally discussed or thought of as such. The magickal uses of these plants are only briefly mentioned afterwards.<br /><br />The last chapter of the book discusses using these plants for cursing or bottling. Melusine has one of the most balanced views I’ve seen on cursing. She does not dismiss cursing as ethically wrong while placing emphasis on the seriousness of doing so and the magickal coin that such a working may cost the witch in the long run. She also warns that a curse cannot be undone by the one who’s cast it. Her preferred method is bottling, which seems to be somewhere between a curse and a binding which she believes can be undone by unbottling the spell itself. She then concludes the book by giving a good number of her bottling spells to stop various forms of harassment, incorporating the use of baneful plants.";1485042556000;The Shadow World Of Plants And Their Poisons is a great introduction into the world of baneful plants;AGSPJHH7ECPJEP3FS5IDHWP2JIOQ;False

And while Courage was mostly solid and on-point, Ryan's logic in one of the chapters was disturbing. He stated we must be courageous...but not for the wrong causes. And he called out ""anti-vaxxers"" as a group that has no justification for their stance. He was clearly calling out those who are refusing the covid jab, not necessarily those who are against proven vaccines.<br /><br />I have a big problem with this logic. First, I do agree that some causes are terrible for humanity, and anyone who stands behind them is not a hero and needs to be called out. The KKK, world leaders and groups promoting genocide, etc.<br /><br />However, the covid jab example is a terrible one, because this is not settled science. The jury is still out regarding the long-term safety of these treatments. As I write this, the jabs are still technically in phase 3 trials as they're being rolled out to billions. Dozens of highly credentialed scientists from institutions such as Harvard and Stanford are expressing deep concerns over their safety. I respect everyone's decision to take or refuse it, and standing up for what you believe is commendable.<br /><br />But to say that skeptics of this vax are cowards and are not practicing courage? I'm sorry, but if anyone is practicing courage right now it is the medical professionals, scientists, airline pilots, and everyday workers who are willing to lose their jobs because they are against the government forcing them to get jabbed. It's the parents who refuse to have their young kids jabbed out of societal pressure ... because they've spent hours doing deep research. It's the whistleblowers who come out and expose the lies, fraud and corruption inside Big Pharma.<br /><br />You can't have it both ways, Ryan. If you want to encourage everyone to be more courageous, you can't also be the arbiter of truth. It's not up to you to decide who's on the right side and who's on the wrong side--especially when it comes to something that's not yet settled. Sure, you can have and offer an opinion. You can tell us what you stand for. But you need to respect the beliefs of others. You really should have picked a different example. Because this particular example made me question your judgement.<br /><br />Time will tell who was truly on the right side of this issue. And that requires courage from ALL sides, not just your side, amigo.";1639584941295;Good book but some disturbing, flawed thinking inside;AH3KQNJMUVTZAW33K7QKQ7PZZXKA;True

Gives you some chords, has a few etudes, and then repeats this process while at the same time relating the new chords it presents to the older stuff you just learned.  The book assumes you are not retarded, have a bit of motivation and takes off from there.  Well worth the time of the intermediate guitar player to go through this bad boy a few times a year until the information is fully absorbed.

Alba left her convent at Ely so she, and her sisters, could start in a new place.<br /><br />A stranger is found murdered, one sister disappears and Alba's actions belie her calling, forcing Helewise to sequester Alba in a locked chamber.  In order to decide what action to take, Helewise must travel to Ely and the girl's home in order to learn of their past and determine their future.<br /><br />The Hawkenlye books remind me a bit of S.J. Rozen's series in that the Abbess and Josse take turns as lead protagonist in each book.  This story belongs to the Abbess.<br /><br />It's a classic traditional mystery set in a medieval time where the church play a predominate role in the characters' lives but there is a touch of the ancient druid as well.  The Abbess and Josse are wonderful characters--the nun and the warrior--and an excellent balance to each other, each with their own strengths.<br /><br />The mystery is compelling and as much psychological as it is physical.  I am always fascinated by details of medieval life.<br /><br />Highly recommended for lovers of historical mysteries, I am pleased to know I have many more books ahead of me in this series.;1215029865000;3.5 Stars - The Abbess in the lead;AGY5JM4JIEL6RX6X6NLULXZB7DOQ;False

After 8 years, she found a strategy that improved her symptoms and she began creating this graphic memoir to document the difficult period before her diagnosis.<br /><br />If you are curious about what it can be like to live with ME/CFS or any other devastating chronic illness, this collection of comics might be a good choice. It doesn’t deal much with the author’s interactions with the medical community, her diagnosis, or whatever strategies eventually helped her. However, it does illustrate some of the difficulties in living with chronic illness, particularly the emotional aspects. It’s not a very coherent story though; it’s more like a collection of personal essays in comic form.<br /><br />As someone who is also living with disabling chronic illnesses, I have been through some similar experiences and I could relate to some of what the author describes. However, I didn’t care for the art style, didn’t enjoy most of the stories, and didn’t learn anything of value to me at this point in my journey, having been sick for many years. I did enjoy “Dark Rides,” the author’s story of planning a graphic novel set in a Disney-style theme park.<br /><br />Having a disabling chronic illness can be very isolating, and sometimes it feels like no one else understands what it’s like. If you’re experiencing that, then this book might help. It didn’t really resonate with me, but your mileage may vary. I hope that it helps bring more awareness to ME/CFS and other invisible disabilities.<br /><br />I was provided an ARC through NetGalley that I volunteered to review.";1667304579682;Somewhat disjointed graphic memoir about living with debilitating chronic illness;AHB2ZGYIV34DOS7RMPAVTAUS2TPA;False

First, there is no hint anywhere on the book jacket that ""Touchstone"" is the first of a series, and that alone is enough to annoy me. A reader who puts down $25.99 of her hard-earned cash for a book has every right to know that this is only the beginning of her investment. It looks like Melanie Rawn will carry this through at least three books, but it's simply greed for Tor, or any other publisher, to not let prospective readers know what they're buying.<br /><br />Next, ""Touchstone"" just isn't that good. Rawn has a nice conceit - that the magic of the theater is, in great part, actual magic - and her narrative about the rise of a magic-based theater troupe is adequate, though a bit heavy on the gloom and doom even when things are going well. In fact, the gloom and doom never really lets up, which is explained in part by the fact that this is the first of a series, but of course how would anyone know that who doesn't work at Tor?<br /><br />Lastly, there's a nice glossary, but it's stuck at the end of the book.

She is grown by then, and enjoying the independence of the life she has chosen.<br /><br />Or does it begin many years before, when her two parents, Owen and Lidia, met in Pawtucket, Rhode Island?  That beginning would set the stage for a family of secrets and lies.<br /><br />Muriel had always known that she was the unwanted child.  Pia, her gorgeous sister, was the oldest and eight years her senior.  Next came Logan, the son for her father.  One child for Owen and one for Lidia.  Then there was chubby Muriel, the outsider, who doesn't fit in.  She can sense her mother's disapproval of her in every facial expression; her sister's feelings show when she treats her like a nuisance.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0062279939 Two Sisters: A Novel]] is a sad and emotional tale of all the things that go wrong in a family when the two parents feel trapped and disappointed with the lives they're living.  How does the third child survive the emotional abandonment?<br /><br />I enjoyed the depth of the characters.  Muriel's sense of humor came from a place of pain, but revealed the strength of the survivor.  Pia's superficiality was altered as she came to Muriel with a big secret:  a tragic event that would change all of their lives.  And finally, in New Mexico, we meet Logan again, as the last of the secrets and lies are revealed.<br /><br />In the opening scenes of the story, the flashbacks and fast forwards sometimes came too quickly, jolting me a bit.  But then I began to settle into the flow of it.<br /><br />There was a sweet feeling of new beginnings at the end.  Not in an unrealistic way, but in the manner of baby steps and slow progress.

1616204745;5;1616204745;4.0;Hunter loses his wife Kait at a very early age. He wasn't ready to say goodbye to her. They had so many plans for things to do before they settled down to start a family. So many places they wanted to visit. So when she died suddenly, he was devastated and did what probably everyone wants to do when they can't face things. He runs away. I say runs away, he actually takes Kait (in ashes form) on holiday. A road trip around the US having spun his globe to decide where to go. This book follows his adventure as he sees the sights, revisits old haunts, meets interesting people, all the time updating his progress, with pictures, on social media garnering interesting comments from friends and family. All the time avoiding his rather dysfunctional in-laws and his own family.<br />Well, this book sounds very morbid but, like the film Grace is Gone, that morbidity often takes second place to the shenanigans that Hunter finds himself in. There are some quite funny parts in this book too and also a lot of tender, heart wrenching moments. I really went through the whole spectrum of emotions whilst reading it. No one should ever tell someone else how to cope with death, how to grieve. It is a completely personal experience and here, although Hunter's reaction could be considered extreme. I personally think it is brave. Going against what is expected but friends and family and simply doing what's right for him to get through this time. Yes, he did a lot of strange things, got himself into scrapes that he really could have avoided but, at the same time, came across as human and, as such, flawed. What started out as potentially the start of his breakdown turned into a voyage of discovery. Through people he met, things he saw and experienced, he started to be able to close that chapter of his life leaving me as a reader lots to thinks about as I followed him on this journey.<br />This is another debut author who is going on my watch list. Although this book didn't blow me away completely, it was a good solid read that still, 7 days later, has me thinking about it.

I randomly came across this book on Amazon, fell in love with the cover design, read a few top reviews, and decided to buy it. Big mistake. The thing about NYTBS books is that making that list is usually a matter of promotion, numbers (popularity), and of course, the Almighty dollar. In short, making the NYTBS list doesn't insure literary quality. And this book proves my point--it was a thorough disappointment. I like my poetry to be creative, profound, deep. This was none of that.  It was more like a collection of remixed Instagram and Tumblr quotes. It read like a bunch of random snippets from her journal. I felt no connection to the author's words, it didn't feel authentic, and at times, I feel as though she wasn't even talking to the reader...and isn't that the point of writing--to speak to the reader? This book was such a let down. I feel that she feigned her depth, and the one poem that I did enjoy was paid homage to Warsan Shire--they weren't even her words!!

You’d never expect that a plant based smoothie recipe titled “cookie dough” would ACTUALLY taste delicious like cookie dough, BUT IT DOES! I tell everyone about this book, but also warn that unless you are committed to preparing a smoothie every day, then this may not be worth it...only because, unless you are already consuming a primarily plant based diet, then you will likely have to purchase a lot of superfood ingredients to create a pantry to make the delicious and nutritious smoothies in this book. That being said, for me, it’s worth it! I was not consuming a plant based diet when I started making these smoothies...in fact I wasn’t even on a diet, I just wanted a healthy boost in the morning that would help start my brain and fuel me until lunch; However, once I established the pantry and started my day with one of these delicious smoothies, I quickly began to feel and realize the benefits of such a diet, and since I already had the ingredients on hand, it was easy to start making more plant based meals, beyond smoothies! All the recipes make two perfect servings, just enough for two adults. I usually drink my smoothie on the drive into work, and most of them will keep me full until lunch. There are some less bulky ones where I find I need to eat a granola bar or snack in between meals though. There are only two I haven’t made, because they call for sea buckthorn, which is the most expensive superfood ingredient in this book, and with only two recipes it didn’t feel worth it. I started off by picking a few recipes that looked good that could share superfoods and gradually advanced until I had a fully stocked superfood pantry. It also helps to keep a good variety of frozen fruit on hand so you can quickly whip up a smoothie on a whim. Great investment, if your looking for delicious recipes to start your day and inprove your health.";1507077606835;They are all SO GOOD!

038574126X;1;038574126X;4.0;Seventeen-year-old Cadence Sinclair has spent almost every summer at her wealthy but dysfunctional family's private island in New England.  She's now tortured by migraines and amnesia after an accident two years ago that she can never quite remember.  During the course of this summer, she gradually makes the connection between her injuries, her bond with the cousins closest to her in age, the pressure from her mother and aunts to seem normal no matter what, and her love for an outsider.  She uses fairy tales as a prism to view her own supposed fairy tale existence, and discovers what those familiar with the musical _Into the Woods_ or Bettelheim's _The Uses of Enchantment_ know:  the families in fairy tales are, for the most part, seriously damaged.  What she finally learns about herself is shattering.<br />As others have commented, you have to read this book at least twice.  The first time, you read it for the beauty of the prose, and for the dead-on portrait of a family whose privilege is its curse:  if they were less well-bred, and just yelled or threw things, they wouldn't be so messed-up.  The second time, you read it looking for alternate interpretations of conversations and incidents that seemed straightforward the first time you read them.  One of the most stunning things about the second read is the discovery that Cadence's perception is often shared by a cousin or an aunt, and she has never been as cut-off as she may have felt.<br />Read it, be patient, and don't skip.  If I don't give 5 stars, it's because after this second reading, I'm not sure I can ever face it again.

0684815001;7;0684815001;5.0;"Before my Classical Judeo-Christian Literature class started this book, my teacher told us to pick it up and hold it.  ""Some books,"" he said, ""are worth just holding in your hands because of the weight of what is written in them.""<br /><br />This was one of those books.<br /><br />The Cost of Discipleship is one of the greatest works of the twentieth century.  Written by German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer on the eve of World War II, it takes a frighteningly direct approach to the call of Christ to discipleship.<br /><br />Bonhoeffer begins by telling the Church that we are preaching grace entirely wrong.  Grace is not a license to sin, a pass to live however we want, or an excuse from the law; it is a call to the law, a command to live blamelessly before God.  It's a harsh blow, but one that needs to be made.  And the blows keep coming.<br /><br />Throughout the book Bonhoeffer takes the life and ministry of Jesus Christ - primarily the Sermon on the Mount - lays the text open, and says, ""This is what Jesus said.  Now, deal with it.""  The Church has done everything in its power to water down, lighten up, spiritualize, and symbolize the words of Christ.  Bonhoeffer calls us to take Jesus at His word and listen to what He actually said.<br /><br />This is an incredibly difficult book to read, not because of the way it's written, but because of what is written in it.  The Cost of Discipleship challenges every aspect of Christian life, demanding more than what we ever thought was possible to give.<br /><br />Just like Jesus did.<br /><br />One of the things that makes this book so amazing is that its author actually lived its words.  Bonhoeffer challenged the German Christians to take a stand for Christ against Hitler - and eventually, he died for it.<br /><br />This book is beyond powerful.

Subjects discussed include a  woman's body, growing up, women in music, women in the media, sex, and  more.  This book does NOT talk about how to trap yourself a man by  foregoing your own opinions and pleasure, how to diet until you look like  Kate Moss, or anything else that masquerades in most women's magazines as  empowering when all the time it is actually chipping away at your  self-worth.

1478255293;0;1478255293;5.0;"You will not find a cliché story about hobbits and elves. There are no naïve, euphemistic narratives that have already been replayed by a hundred authors before. Rather, this is an intriguing revelation of humanity -past, present and future. What and where are the gods of legend and lore?<br /><br />Furthermore, what if a creature that had been placed in a deep slumber awoke having all that knowledge inside of him? Not the pseudo histories of life that we think or believe must exist, but the TRUE visage of the actual history of the world and the beings from the golden and bronze ages? Could the gods of old, entities depicted within all areas of humanity throughout time, have actually existed? And perhaps they were more human than their given legends which have become myth and fodder for fables.<br /><br />What wondrous creatures they must have been to have divined such a paradise within the Golden Age. What type of homo supersapiens could have left such a mark is beyond our actual knowledge or comprehension because we have nothing but fragments of the broken past to help us substantiate our history.<br /><br />There is a creature, a dwarf, who has such knowledge of truth. There is one being left in the entire world that can recreate the history which we have only been able to fabricate with our common sense driven imaginings. This dwarf has awoken within the Iron Age of man, where the humans have spawned themselves as kings of the earth, to shed light on our true past. As the greatest historian of the old world, he was chosen by their king to be placed in a deep sleep so that he can awaken in the age of Iron to pen the truth. He knows that the golden age of the homo supersapiens will return. He manages to remain unseen while finding resources within the human's concrete and strange world. He writes down the truths of the old world and in it you will find the strange and VERY true anomalies of our past and histories examined and explored.<br /><br />This will broaden your vantage of commonplace historical renderings. Utilizing real texts, from the Bible to Plato, he has given us this unique vision of our history and a race of humans that may have truly existed in some fashion. The dwarf details of the great war near the end of the bronze age and the last age of the gods; their interactions in the world and the ramifications of the humans.<br /><br />The author's knowledge and grasp of history is extraordinary. Throughout the book you will read histories of the world complete with their references.  He implements his own philosophical and intelligent theories into that showcase containing some of the most intriguing stories of our real world. From the lost civilization of Atlantis to the blocking of the strait of Gibraltar, if you fancy piecing together the remnant fabric of our past then this book will appeal to you. Elegantly written and FASCINATING from beginning to end!<br /><br />Jos Rogiers has an incredible ability to connect ideas and pull hypothesis from shreds of actual historical accounts. It made me re-think the lost past that we can only really guess at, and the race of humans who were so grand that we call them gods.<br /><br />What about the idea of immortality? The gods are not immortal, but their souls are; Buddha being a reincarnation. So many things are touched upon that I can't even begin to describe them in a review. The ""underdeveloped brains of humans"" have a hard time with deeper conceptualizations, but with this book you will enter a reality within a reality. Such depth in writing is a gem and here you will find a treasure.";1358912348000;A dwarf awakens to pen the truth...;AGKCWMGAWMSR7DSJ7CHAEJZUIVCQ;False

088448324X;0;088448324X;5.0;Keep Your Ear on the Ball is a truly touching story that is a non-fiction book by Genevieve Petrillo. The story focuses on a third grade student named Davey who is blind and struggles with the amount of pity he gets from his classmates, due to his disability. The author, Genevieve Petrillo, actually taught the real life Davey a number of years ago and inspired her to write this book to help other students understand what a disability like blindness brings about. Throughout the book the other students are constantly being nice and trying to assist Davey in anything and everything, but unfortunately all Davey wants to do is to accomplish these tasks on his own. Once Davey finally acts out and says that he does not need the assistance the other students take it the wrong way and isolate him in a way. For example, one day at recess the students are playing kickball and Davey strikes out. After that day the other students stopped picking Davey for their teams and he was left to himself at recess, until they constructed a special ball with a bell on it for him. This can be a scary and accurate truth for blind individuals being included in society and theirs not always a ball with a bell on it to help them. As far as inclusion in Davey's classroom goes I believe he should be included in general education classroom with proper accommodations.<br /> I read online that the real Davey had a braille teacher and had braille written text books to help him learn, which ultimately lead him to high school and then college. Genevieve Petrillo's story would serve as a great read aloud to your students. Personally, I would use this book as a read aloud activity for my students in my classroom. It would help students to see what a blind or disabled life is like in a fun and interactive way. Furthermore, it would serve as a great introductory tool for your students on how to help accommodate for not only the blind, but others who have disabilities.<br /> Overall, I found this book amazing and inspiring due to it being a true story with a great ending. I would strongly recommend this book to any teacher for their classroom and also for any parent to read to their child. Genevieve Petrillo does a great job captivating the importance of inclusion of disabilities in society and also the interactive nature that comes along with it.;1360814400000;Review:  Charles Kelly;AF7JOSUXYGA2RES4N4WPCMLE4HBQ;False

Dathan Auerbach doesn't get you with flowery prose, rather he has perfectly captured a grounded, slowburning, nerve-wracking tale. There are no ghosts or demons here, only the evils of man.<br /><br />The reader gets to piece together the story as our unnamed protagonist makes sense of his past. Seemingly mundane events as a kid are actually part of a twisted person's plot<br /><br />Refreshingly, the book doesn't a traditional structure or plot. Storytelling is nonlinear and takes place over the protagonist's childhood. I'd advise readers who are expecting something, say, Stephen King-esque to keep this in mind.<br /><br />As I mentioned, the novel is a slowburner, which means there aren't monsters jumping out or bloody massacres, and such. However, I find that the story and how its told is potent enough to keep the reader's (at least for me) interest enough to keep reading through page after page.<br /><br />Overall, ""Penpal"" is an impressive debut novel by Dathan Auerbach and I look forward to reading more of his work in the future.";1601546437519;An impressive debut novel;AEM4ZD3NYIQZTMHUW7QPHN7H3ZXQ;True

Thomson's a good writer and critic but too idiosyncratic to be a ""guide"" to anything. The book could have used an index and a listing of all the films reviewed. Still, for all its flaws, the book is worth seeking out. The best thing about Thomson is that he thinks for himself, doesn't fall back on jargon or theory, thus at his best he's brilliant and insightful, at his worst, slick and facile.

1537053426;0;1537053426;4.0;Sierra Riley has put out another great read. I found this book to be quite charming. Martin was such an introvert and it was nice seeing how Travis was able to get close to him and coax him out of that thanks to the cooking lessons/dinner auction. Martin made so many sacrifices to raise his sister, Lisa, and it was good that she more or less forced him into bidding in the auction that basically changed his life for the better. Travis was so caring and patient with Martin. Together they nurtured their relationship and both blossomed.<br /><br />I like the way the author handled the financial aspect of their relationship. Martin had a lot of money and Travis didn't. It was just that, a fact. Travis never felt insecure or less than because he didn't have the money that Martin had.

1573922285;9;1573922285;1.0;"I do not belong to any Christian church but I am interested in problems in the philosophy of religion. When I opened up Drange's book, I thought it would offer a rigorous point-by-point refutation of God's existence and thus make a good, challenging read. Instead I found him to be most uncharitable to his opponents. Just as one example, on p. 183 Drange quotes a paragraph from an essay by Marilyn McCord Adams, a theist and philosopher well-respected in academia, but then goes on to write that he doesn't understand terms Adams uses such as ""inner life of God"" and ""beatific vision."" But is Drange even trying to understand her words on her terms? It is hard to see that he is. Instead he runs roughshod over the whole passage and dismisses her ideas, whatever they might mean, out of hand. The book goes on and on like this. In my experience the most rewarding critiques extend far in building up opposing arguments that at first look weak or inscrutable, to better make one's case. Give the other side its best showing, not its most impoverished form which Drange does repeatedly. It doesn't take an ""evangelical"" or ""liberal"" Christian to dislike the arrogance that works its way into and compromises Drange's argument. A more worthwhile book to me is ""Sense and Nonsense in Religion"" by Sten H. Stenson. Intending to write a refutation of theism, Stenson ended up taking the opposite view by drawing comparisons between puns and religious experience.

1501126121;0;1501126121;5.0;"Glenn Beck wrote a very profitable essay on Islam and he hit every point that our American society should take into consideration, especially if one still believes our Country was founded on Judea-Christian morality.  Whereas Islam follows a messenger, the prophet Muhammad to answer to a fake god, named “Allah” and none of his teaching are true or believable, yet it’s just getting people killed around the world by yes, following just another “man,” a human being and not of a true god.  Was Jesus Christ, “Jeshua” merely a messenger of God like Muhammad believed he was for Allah?  Muhammad created a pagan god, called Allah, the “moon-god,” from the last of Mecca’s other pagan gods; in order to control the illiterate masses for great profits and to feed his sexual appetite.  Not only was Muhammad illiterate too; he was a pedophile, rapist, murderer, thief, liar, and a racist Jew hater.  Do we need to say more but do we wonder why the same illiterate followers adds up to 1.4 billion when we see the same so-called intellectual-enablers encourage this madness by calling them a religion of peace?  Do we allow the godless, satanical followers of a 100-year-old worn-out left-wing progressive movement still dictate to us by force?  For this enlightenment, I give Mr. Beck Five Stars, but please read on...<br /><br />The point Mr. Beck missed was for those poor saps who believes in “man,” no matter how charismatic they may appear, they still place all their eggs in that man’s baskets but soon they will see their eggs rot.  Throughout history, everytime lazy people follow another “man” and not place their faith through grace in the true God through His Son will soon come up empty, if not dead.<br />Once upon a time “they” followed Hitler, Stalin, &#34;Che&#34; Guevara, Mao, Castro brothers and now Obama; but be aware that the ever continuing list of megalomaniacs through history, you’ll see your like image in their mirrors, like I’m sure Beck has.  The image he sees is Joseph Smith, and just like the prophet Muhammad, you’ll realize very little difference with the Mormons as with the Muslims.  They both put their religious stock and worship towards a false belief system that is dictated by mere men, mortals and godless bullies.  No one should ever follow anyone else before God; be it from the Saints’ Paul, Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John and even Moses.  They would tell you the same, to only follow God through his Son, Jeshua, and not through mortals; but only to follow the Divine Deity who created man in the first place and follow His promise and listen through your prayers.<br /><br />I’m first gave Glenn Beck “One Star,” not because he wrote a bad essay but because of his wounded ego who was once saved from alcoholism by the alluring Mormons pontificating and capturing his soul like Satan did through Islam that maybe, just maybe Beck will listen and understand that this is his wake-up call for his soul and I pray he’ll understand the hypocrisy of any beliefs whatsoever with anything to do with Mormonism on man’s table of life aside from man’s betrayal of leading those astray from His Son in place of a “Smith” or a “Muhammad” with tyrannical agendas.  Neither one is a religion based on faith but rather they are manmade middle age or 19th century crap that could lead one astray to their judgement day.<br /><br />Just try to tell the “Elders” you want to quit the LDS and I’m positive you receive a similar reception as if a Muslim converting to Christianity would receive if that Muslim attempted to commit what they call an apostasy.  Tell them the Koran and the Book of Mormon is crap too and that you have accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior and the Truth is written in the Torah and Holy Bible; or, maybe they would kill you too.<br /><br />God Bless you, Glenn…";1441672195000;Islam vs. Mormonism;AH64XBO3CQI6BZPVGL2MBILLRWVQ;True

0151007209;2;0151007209;4.0;The works of Aristotle were first suppressed and then lost for centuries in Western Europe after the fall of the Roman world.  The works of Aristotle were suppressed because of their emphasis on reason and logic that ran contrary to the principles of faith.  These important writings were preserved and commented upon by Islamic theologians only to fall back into the hands of Christendom in 12th century Spain.<br /><br />Rubenstein explains in the clearest and most succinct terms how the introduction of Aristotelian concepts reinvigorated theological thought in the late Middle Age and early Renaissance.  The Scholastics argued that the gap between reason and faith could be bridged.  The debate among those who supported this position such as Thomas Aquinas and Bonaventure were often at loggerheads with the Catholic Church and its hegemony over medieval culture.  Concepts such as the Double Truth exemplified the efforts of these great thinkers to link reason and faith.<br /><br />Later thinkers were to show that Aristotelian notions were not scientific.  And to link faith and reason is illogical.  For example, Thomas Hobbs and Martin Luther disparaged Aristotle's works leading the way to our modern separation of faith (as subjective) and reason (as objective).<br /><br />Rubenstein is immensely readable and he provides a most persuasive explanation of how the re-discovery of Aristotle's works changed the modern world.;1120491246000;The Philosopher;AGN6WK7ACN5RVZJGCBDQRKU5BIWQ;False

1608866890;0;1608866890;4.0;Really good fun with good artwork.<br /><br />This graphic novel is both educational and amusing. It is a story about the crab,  Cancer Simplicimus Vulgaris, otherwise known as the square crab.<br /><br />Unlike other kinds of crab this one can only crawl in a straight line. They cannot change direction and as a result suffer all kinds of indignities and bullying from other crabs, human beings and fate in general. And they seem unable to change this until three crabs decide that enough is enough and that they are going to rebel against the confines of the straight and narrow path, and do something very different.<br /><br />As they initiate this monumental plan of rebellion, other things are happening that influence their destiny. Greenpeace are staging a blockade which goes horribly wrong, two cameramen decide that the crabs would be an excellent documentary subject and the crabs themselves suddenly realise that working together can help them achieve their freedom and this graphic novel shows us what happens to the evolution of Cancer Simplicimus Vulgaris when the pieces to the puzzle fall into place.<br /><br />This is the first highly entertaining volume of the three part series.

0307387879;0;0307387879;4.0;The concept behind this novel is simple: Faulks pretends to be Ian Fleming, and sets the novel in the late 60's, pretty much when Fleming would have set it had he not died.  There are plenty--perhaps too many-references to recent Fleming novels. But the tone and narrative force of the novel clearly bring back the flavor of Ian Fleming himself.<br /><br />Although parts of the novel seem inspired by some of the tired set pieces from the films, at its heart is well written novel. The power of this novel does not come from its plot, which has some fits and starts, and which suffers from some predicitability, but from its characterizations. Faulks has captured the feel of Fleming's novels and that feel is decidedly  literary, not cinematic.

Her major struggle is her dyslexia-in those days, dyslexia was unknown so people who had trouble with reading and writing were labelled ""dumb"" and ""slow."" Rose dreads school and has already been held back twice,and is threatened to be held back yet again. Rose is friendless and picked on severely by most of her teachers. During troublesome times like these, she turns to her Irish Chain quilt, made by her grandmother, and the stories of its patches give her comfort. One day Rose prays to God that she should not have to go to school anymore. Her prayers were answered on December 6, 1917, when two ships, one loaded with explosives, crash in Halifax's harbour. The crash destroys nearly the entire North part of Halifax, and resulted in the greatest human tragedy Canada had ever seen. Throughout the turmoil,grief-stricken Rose must find her remaining family members, face the pain of loss, and gain inner strength and courage from the stories of the quilt patches to piece her life back together.

1481924265;1;1481924265;5.0;"This delightful coming-of-age novel takes us on a tour of a life that is torn by war on a number of levels. At the most obvious level, 10-year-old Johnny is affected by the beginning of World War II. His best friend, Wes Namura, is sent to a Japanese detention camp. Childhood fantasies of war games permeate his play. His much-older enemy, the abused and slightly insane school bully, Manny Robineau, takes the war games seriously and gets lost in the fantasy.<br /><br />Johnny's home is the focus of another war. His father, a successful and wealthy movie producer, is lost in drink most of the time, while his mother struggles to keep up appearances and maintain a reasonable life.<br /><br />Then come the casualties of war. He often comes home and finds his father entertaining wounded soldiers and war veterans, usually by getting them drunk. More important casualties to Johnny are the deaths of the people he loves--his girlfriend, Molly; the motherly cook at his home, Libby; his Aunt Agnes, who comes for a visit and shares her wisdom. His good friend, Ted Goshen, is struggling with polio and, though he does not die, is also one of the casualties.<br /><br />Considine does a beautiful job of taking us into Johnny's personality and his life. Johnny is an interesting character. He's serious and funny, a master BS artist. However, he is plagued by noises and voices in his head that rarely give him a moment's peace. This is counter-balanced by his ability to see people as they were when they were younger and as they will be as they age. If he cannot see someone beyond the present, it means they're going to die soon. This is not always something he wants to know.<br /><br />This is a fascinating novel, full of laughs and heart breaks.

0991163451;0;0991163451;5.0;"The Myths of Christianity by Jeddiah McClure is well written, entertaining, and insightful, taking the reader on “a five thousand year journey to find the Son of God.”<br /><br />McClure provides numerous examples of how our concepts about Jesus evolved, heavily influenced by ancient myths, noting that the beliefs that modern Christians have accepted as gospel were shaped by “countless pagan beliefs, symbols and stories” that conformed to the times.  I was surprised to learn, for example, that the Persians had one of the most enduring influences on the laws, religion and culture of the Jewish people; and that these would form the roots of primitive Christianity’s belief in a spiritual Savior, resurrection, Satan, final judgment, and the afterlife.<br /><br />To keep his analysis accessible to the lay reader, McClure uses modern examples to illustrate how the followers of Christ changed the teachings of Jesus over the centuries in the same way disciples of Bruce Lee modified their master’s teachings after Lee’s death to serve their own agendas. McClure says that authors of the Bible borrowed ideas from other religious sources, just as J. K. Rowling, the author of the popular Harry Potter series of books, drew from other literary sources, including the novel “Jane Eyre.”<br /><br />This book is must reading in this age of religious intolerance, where acts of violence are perpetrated against those whose spiritual practices differ from ours. To paraphrase the author’s concluding, and perhaps most important, message: Jesus taught that the two most important spiritual laws are to love God and to love one another.";1420836751000;Must reading for anyone interested in Christianity!;AFFOKGTFMXO2KOZ433ZEM3D2B3VA;False

0252071883;2;0252071883;2.0;"The late Leta Miller was a musicologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz. She specialized in 20th Century music. Miller was a good and workmanlike writer, but her book belongs to a category of worshipful professional biographies of 20th Century avant-garde composers that turned their backs on audiences, leaving the musical traditions of five centuries behind. Examples of other avante-gardists with diverse styles but common attitudes include Babbitt, Stockhausen, Cage, Nono, Dallapiccolo, Ligeti, and Boulez.  As an audience-oriented advocate of musical reform, I suggest that a quote by choreographer Mark Morris, cited in Miller's book,  does a good job in describing Harrison's role in American music: ""You either know Lou and have been to his house and are his best friend, or you've never heard of him"".<br /><br />For Harrison and other musical revolutionaries of the early-middle 20th Century, any earnest experimental approach to music making was acceptable and artistic, provided it thumbed its nose at ordinary music lovers. The tragedy for development of music and society as a whole, in my mind, is that this esthetic was embraced by the professional music establishment. It abandoned the previous conception of music as an expressive form of communication that linked composers, audiences, performers (professional and amateur), religious congregations, and children, etc. in a common love.  The use of music to entertain, inspire, or console was replaced by music as a means of political protest or self actualization by composers and a tiny circle of cognoscenti. Rejection of compositions by audiences became something like proof of the artistic integrity and depth of the composer.<br /><br />Earlier ""in your face"" styles have been largely abandoned by the establishment. But the tabu on music composed for ordinary music lovers has not changed.  Composers can compose in neolassical styles that reviewers often refer to as ""assimilable"" (i.e. not openly offensive or disturbing) but must avoid music designed to really appeal to audiences or have it rejected as ""derivative"" or pandering to low public taste.<br /><br />What this has done is confine contemporary composition to an academic ghetto. Larger classical music organizations dependent on ticket buying or other support by the public include occasional contemporary compositions in programs as a symbol that they have not totally abandoned active musical creation. But the vast majority of repertory dates back to pre-music revolution styles with emphasis on the 19th and 18th centuries.<br /><br />Without meaningful music that speaks to today, classical music has had an ever declining role in the musical life of society. Young people who don't have family or other special background that introduces them to the marvelous world of classical music are almost completely rock based. We have more virtuosic performers than ever before, but ever grayer audiences for whom to play.<br /><br />Unfortunately, faculty of conservatories or music departments who understand the problem are constrained in writing about it. I encourage all music lovers who long for new musical inspiration to take interest and refuse to be intimidated about speaking up.";1379404243000;A worshipful book about a 20th Century musical experimenter and obscurantist;AGUIQQT4VURTMHDEWTQQLZ2JMX4A;False

They identify a “problem” that cannot be defined, which will never have a solution, that appeals to emotion, and obtain power, fame and money using it.

B0007HE93U;0;B0007HE93U;5.0;"This thought provoking booklet consists of two tracts-The first is Horatius Bonar's 'God's Will And Man's Will.He answers several questions concerning the relation that God's will has to man's will,primarily,Whose will is first?Bonar is not denying that both God and man have wills that are exerted,but he insists that &#34;nothing in the universe takes place without the will of God.&#34; Concerning God's Sovereign will as it relates to good and evil Mr.Bonar believed-&#34;nothing that is good can exist which God did not will to be,and nothing that is evil can exist which God did not will to allow.&#34; I am very confident that the author has strong Biblical support for this sweeping notion.It would also account for the existence of evil(even though Almighty God is all powerful and is also perfectly Holy and good).The Lord God did allow for the possibility of evil,however that does not make Him the perpetrator of any evil acts.What Horatius Bonar is contending for is 'The Absolute Sovereign Will Of God'.Thus it is man's enmity toward his creator which opposes this(his self will and rebellion towards the living God are clearly manifested in his opposition to God's rule over all He has created and His providential outworking of His will throughout man's history).<br /><br />In the second part of this booklet(tract)'The Will Of God' A.W.Pink explains the distinction,as he puts it,that the older Calvinists used ,between God's revealed will and His secret will.The believers duty is to walk in obedience to the revealed will of God(which is clearly set forth in His Word-The Bible).God's secret will is everything that actually comes to pass.God's will is always accomplished (in some sense)as Mr.Pink succinctly states it-&#34;God's revealed will is frequently crossed,but His secret will is never thwarted.&#34; Romans 9:19 &#34;...Why Doth He yet find fault?For who has resisted His will?' This verse in Romans has the secret will of God in view,and is a rhetorical question(the obvious answer being that no one can resist His will-all that the Lord has purposed will come to pass(and through the means which He has ordained)for none can stay His hand.No one has the right to even question what He is doing.<br /><br />Understanding God's will and man's will,and how they relate to each other is not just theological gymnastics,but it has extremely practical implications.It is an important component in the pursuit of holiness,and Biblical sanctification in general,as this quote from A.W.Pink(from Spiritual Union And Communion)will demonstrate-&#34;we need to continually pray Him to save us from having any will of our own,to work in us complete subjection to and satisfaction with His holy will.&#34; If that is one's mindset and they seek strength and grace from the Lord,to work that increasingly in their heart and life,then I believe there will be great advancement in holy living.";1401739036000;God's Will-Absoulutely Sovereign;AHKEXU72QL33Z23GRJGQHVXVST2A;False

0451463137;1;0451463137;4.0;I've been excited to read The Adamantine Palace ever since I first read the synopsis on Amazon a few weeks ago. Now, after reading The Adamantine Palace I can say it doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />The Adamantine Palace's plot contains an exhilarating mix between political subterfuge and the fantastical rebellion of both dragons and outlanders, the people that live outside the kingdoms. These two plot lines mixed seamlessly throughout the book, and the process of jumping back and forth between the different characters offers an interesting and insightful viewpoint into what the other characters are thinking, showing like real life people don't know everything that is going on.<br /><br />But what I like most about The Adamantine Palace was the level of excitement that accompanies each moment of the book. This excitement grows with each page causing the reader to literally sit at the edge of their seat waiting for the exciting conclusion.<br /><br />In fact, the only thing I found a problem with was the immense number of characters that the book switches between in the first few chapters. I initially found this confusing and felt it detracted from the overall story. This is of course rectified as the book continues and as characters die off, but it can be a tad daunting for readers who have just started the book.<br /><br />Of course for all its benefits and flaws, this book is part of a series and so the reader is left with more questions than answers at the end of The Adamantine Palace. But the foundation is set and the anticipation palpable, and I, myself can't wait for the sequel The King of the Crags.<br /><br />[..];1266447368000;The Adamantine Palace;AFZY4EVDODED6XAXI7SCAT7IGXEQ;False

Except for Caballe (for whom this review is principly written), the other singers range from satisfying (Tucker) to somewhat disappointing (Zanasi).  The conducting is somewhat erratic: Schippers chooses very brisk tempi in many spots (i.g., the first act caballetta for Leonora) but also somewhat languid, lethargic tempi in others (the Act IV scena including D'amor and the Miserere).  Now to Caballe:  her performance is off the charts and rates 100 stars!  Just listen to her solo pieces and the verve and thrust she exudes in the duets and trios.  But the crowing jewel of the set is the Act IV aria ""D'amor sull'ali rosee and the scena which includes the Miserere.  This is the Spanish soprano at her finest: pure liquid legato and meltingly floated pianissimi yet all placed in the proper dramatic proportions.  For me, just hearing Caballe sing this music is heavenly, indeed, she does sing like an angel.  While this performance should not be your only recording of the work, it surely ranks as one of the most endearing because of the vocal and dramatic contributions of Caballe's Leonora.

0975922947;21;0975922947;3.0;"Hive is a new publication by Elder Signs Press, just released about a month ago.  The author is Tim Curran.  Even though we are unpacking, as usual most of my mythos books are in a box somewhere and I can't say how many stories by Mr. Curran I may have read.  I never read his other novel, Skin Medicine.  He has written two short stories I saw recently, ""The Eyes of Howard Curlix"" (from Horrors Beyond) and ""The Chattering of Tiny Teeth"" (from Warfear).  Both were well crafted and enjoyable.  The limited edition hardcover of Hive is sold out (I was lucky enough to get a copy) but the trade paperback is available for only $10.85, and eligible for free shipping if the total order is more than $25.  My copy was rather more expensive, but it is a high quality hardback that upholds the high standards set by Elder Signs, and I imagine the paperback is good quality as well.  Page count was 269.  I must mention that the cover art by Dave Carson is phenomenally gorgeous, a shoggoth-like creature arising from the icy depths in an ancient ruined city.  However I would mildly contend whether it represented any actual scene from the book or was more just a terrific Lovecraftian painting.  Editing was tight with minimal typos (especially compared to the disastrous HP Lovecraft Institute).<br /><br />This book is billed as a sequel to ""At the Mountains of Madness.""<br /><br />Sequel: n.<br />1. Something that follows; a continuation.<br />2. A literary, dramatic, or cinematic work whose narrative continues that of a preexisting work.<br />3. A result or consequence.<br />In the sense that it is set in the same environment of the Pabodie expedition, it is a sequel...relying on definition #1.  But I would dispute the aptness of definition #2.  I'll come back to that.  Be advised that some spoilers may follow.<br /><br />The plot is set in the modern era at a scientific research station in Antarctica.  The cast is a collection of scientists, technicians and other misfits who are spending the Antarctic winter doing research, basically cut off from the rest of the world and living in a small oasis in the midst of a harsh and unforgiving landscape.  Some of them are investigating areas previously searched by the Pabodie expedition in ATMOM and the unearth some frozen/mummified Old One cadavers...or are they really cadavers?<br /><br />I really really wanted to like this book.  And I did like the basic conception of the plot and how it was carried out.  Otherwise I had some difficulties with it.  This may read a little like stream of consciousness, alas.  First of all, although Curran used the same setting as ATMOM, and the machinations of the Old Ones were central to the story, it wasn't really a sequel.  I haven't read ATMOM in a few years, but as I recall were not the shoggoths ascendant in the ruins of the Old Ones' city?  Shoggoths did not make an appearance in the book.  But that's OK.  I think we would all rather an author followed his own muse and not just slap together another Lovecraftian pastiche.<br /><br />Part of my indelible response to any Antarctic horror story is informed by John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" (no, he's not a relative, the John Carpenter I'm related to is a commercial artist).  I think this movie is brilliant: frightening, creepy, hysterically funny in parts, with great acting performances and very very Lovecraftian sensibility.  I view it as the best ever Lovecraftian film.  And so I can't help but look for similarities, and I can't help but find them.  Curran himself makes a tributary mention of ""The Thing"" near the end of his text.  Having seen this and Alien, I must say there were no highly original plot twists in Hive to sustain tension.  But on the other hand, as it is set in the same frame of reference as ATMOM we already knew about the bogeymen, so I wasn't put off by this either.<br /><br />And now we come to my greatest issue with Hive, the writing itself.  The prose just did not knock my socks off.  I should note that the idiom made no effort to mimic HPL's prose (which is not a bad thing!).  ATMOM is one of my all time favorite HPL works and it was only about a hundred pages or so.  Word count in ATMOM runs about 41,000 and we know that HPL did not use the most economical prose.  Hive was just too long.  For the most part I think the mythos has been best served by the short story.  The mythos type novels that have really grabbed me have been few: Radiant Dawn and Ravenous Dusk by Goodfellow, Rules of Engagement by Tynes and Balak by Rainey.  Most of the others have not been as good for whatever reason.  In Hive I often felt the whole book should have been edited down to novella length to remove excess verbiage.  For example, there were often, for me, excessive adjectives in oddly structured usage.  Back when I was a teen I actually read about 5 or 6 John Norman Gor novels, you know, the ones before he degenerated into soft core bondage porn, and he would structure sentences like *and too, to me it seemed bold* instead of the more direct *it seemed bold to me*.  Of course Yoda type sentence structure (beautifully lampooned in George Lucas in Love) is even more annoying.  I'm getting off track, there was nothing that bad here, but if something is red, blue and green I'd rather say that than it was red and blue and green.  Doing so once is for effect, more is for affectation.  And bloody vexing when if goes on page after page.  Using 4 to 6 adjectives to describe things in the same sentence also just bogs things down.  Also I think the author just tried a little too hard.  The descriptions are arduous, effortful, and for me did not evoke the intended horror, otherness whatever.  I found the characters lacked life and were frankly not distinctive enough for me to try to keep them straight, or care about their fates.  And the dialogue just didn't ring true, profanity for effect but just sort of falling flat like, well, profanity for effect.  When I compare that to Radiant Dawn where the characters jump off the page, develop and become people I cared about, and where the dialogue bristles, sparkles, keeping me reading at a break neck pace...Hive suffers by comparison.  I set it down a few times and read some other books in between attempts at finishing it.  On the other hand I did not punt on it like I did Nightmare's Disciple and A Darkness Inbred.<br /><br />So a mixed bag here.  The book in paperback is very reasonable priced, eligible for free shipping.  And it was a noble effort.  I did care about the plot and wanted to see where Curran ended the story, and I did think the ending was satisfying (if anticipated by ""the Thing"" again).  I'll give it 3 stars.  I await other opinions with interest.  I certainly will not shy away from Curran's future mythos offerings.";1122526911000;Worth a look;AGUIAOF2QMQ7SK4KIR4POTFBZIGA;False

However, even with my inital disappointment at seeing less of Bartimaeus, Stroud weaves an intricate and complex story that will keep you in suspense toward the end of the book and leave you with more questions than answers.<br /><br />Also, advancement in character development, for me, made up for the slightly gloomier tone, with all three main characters reaching a turning point in their character growth, the most intriguing one, interestingly, being Bartimaeus.<br /><br />Speaking of Bartimaeus, even though his chapters are fewer, they are as witty as ever, even funnier than in the last book, so they will not disappoint.<br /><br /> At first it may be a jarring read for those expecting a similar setup as ""Amulet"", but in my opinion it is still a very enjoyable read, and will make you wait as anxiously for the 3rd book as you did for the second.";1092969984000;Another Great Addition to the Bartimaeus Trilogy;AGAPXIKCMGSVREB7IKDLB6Z2URIA;False

0545101425;52;0545101425;1.0;"I can't really describe how utterly disappointed I was in this final book in the Hunger Games series. After I finished the book, I tossed it aside, sighed, and just went to go lay down. It was a heartbreaking letdown.<br /><br />There's multiple things to address here, so I'll lay it out as clearly as possible.<br /><br />1) The butchering of characters. Katniss went from a feisty, if reluctant heroine, to a dimwitted, sullen child. And I understand that she's been through so much terror, and that how she reacted can be considered a realistic response. But it's truly difficult to like a book if you cannot like the main character. I loved Katniss in the first two books. Hated her in this one. And it was strange how inconsistent her character was. Sometimes she was reasonable and full of compassion, and on the flip side, she's willing to let Captiol children die at the hands of another hunger game. That cold brutality can do nothing but force readers to abandon her as a main character worth anything. Was that the point? Was the point to force you to dislike everyone who touched the war in any way? Did the anti-war message have to be that strong to the point where enjoyment of the book is obliterated? Gale was similarly butchered. I think what grated more with Gale's switch in characterization was that it seemed incredibly obvious that the only point in making Gale a harsh and unfeeling character was to make the decision in the romantic triangle that much easier to make. But I would have preferred Katniss choosing between two good guys, instead of one good guy who went crazy but was still good, and one good guy who turned into a brute.<br /><br />2) The writing itself was so amateurish. How often did Katniss black out and end up in the hospital in this book? Two, three times? It became to the point where I rolled my eyes when it happened. And was seriously about to throw the book at the wall when it happened YET AGAIN at the very climax of the book. Such lazy writing. And the entire structuring of the book felt off. The whole sequence leading up to the President's mansion was the epitome of lackluster and unfulfilled.<br /><br />3) The story was so bleak, the anti-war message so strong, that there was no enjoyment in the book. You couldn't root for the rebels. You couldn't root for Katniss. You couldn't root for Gale or Peeta. You couldn't root for the Capital. So what was the point? Just to read something and think, ""my god, war is BAD BAD BAD!""<br /><br />4) The unnecessary deaths. Really, did the author REALLY have to kill off so many people? Killing off well liked characters for shock value is trite and make me weary.<br /><br />5) The epilogue was so lame. So tacked on. The entire ending of the book felt so rushed and half-hearted.<br /><br />If this was the author's vision, then I guess I can't really argue against it. But I'm superbly disappointed in the direction she chose to take. It probably wouldn't have been so disappointing if I hadn't enjoyed the first two so much, and if I hadn't been so eagerly counting down the days until this book's release. Maybe lower expectations would have made the book easier to swallow, but I doubt it. There were just SO many problems in this book.

Ezquerra and McCrea did a good job illustrating the carnage but this arc would really have benefitted from Robertson's artwork.  However, he did return to the book to illustrate the second arc in this book.  Robertson's love for these characters really shines through and I was very happy that he was able to draw the origins since he is the co-creator.

0452282829;10;0452282829;5.0;"This is a tremendously satisfying novel, in which Joyce Carol Oates goes about as deeply as a novelist can possibly go into the hearts and minds of her characters.  In the process, she illustrates the terrible cost familiy loves and loyalties can exact on its members.  We Were the Mulvaneys manages to be both terribly sad and strangely uplifting, without ever lapsing into melodrama.  It documents the disintegration of an ostensibly invulnerable, loving, and happy American family in the wake of the date rape of the Mulvaney daughter, Marianne, on Valentine's Day, 1976.  The effects of this incident resonate for decades after, and Oates is unsparing in exposing the extremes of love and cruelty that can exist within both the family unit and society as a whole when unwritten taboos are breached.  And of course, palpably present is Oates's fixation with the specter of evil and violence that, for her, always lurks just below the gleaming surfaces of American life.  Yet Oates does not restrict herself to writing a King Lear-like family tragedy, because We Were the Mulvaneys is also a testament to the ability of men and women to somehow survive and rebuild their lives, often in the face of terrible emotional betrayal and neglect.<br /><br />The novel is mostly narrated by the youngest child, Judd Mulvaney, who communicates the vitality and contentment of the Mulvaney family in the years before ""it"" (as the rape is constantly referred to by family and community members) happened.  The Mulvaney patriarch has a successful roofing business in a small town in Upstate New York, and the family lives in a beautiful old home on a small farm eight miles out of town.  Family life on the farm is portrayed as happily chaotic, nurturing, and full of an assortment of reassuring rituals that affirm the Mulvaney's fundamental togetherness.  All in all the reader is left in no doubt as to the strength of the Mulvaney family's love for and loyalty toward each other.<br />Yet when ""it"" happens, we see the fragility of the structure that undergirds family happiness and a family's standing in a small town community.  Suddenly we see the enormous pride of the Mulvaney patriarch, and how that pride turns to shame and a terribly destructive anger once he and the family begin to be subtly ostracized by former friends and acquaintances.  It is at the point where family members become irreversibly alienated from each other and are thrown on their own resources that the novel truly begins, and it's a remarkable journey.<br />Despite the fact that this is a quite large novel, Oates's grip on her narrative never falters, and she manages to lay bare the emotional scars and hopes of all six Mulvaneys as she takes them (and us) through the late seventies, the eighties, and the early nineties--twenty-five years in all.  Oates obviously set very high standards for herself when she wrote We Were the Mulvaneys, and if you make it through this novel, you'll probably feel like I did--that she succeeded brilliantly.";1016384528000;A Family Saga of Epic Dimensions;AEOETRQTH3GTPA3ZSWEHNOPC6QDQ;False

0984835032;6;0984835032;5.0;"Try and imagine the following scenario: your sailboat has crashed on a reef near a deserted island off the coast of Fiji, a gaping hole in its side; you and your family are shipwrecked with no one around to come to your rescue. Fast-forward four years and envision being adrift in the Pacific ocean for almost 90 days. There’s little wind to propel you toward your destination, but it doesn’t matter because your sails are worn out and the motor is broken. There is precious little food on board; the absence of fresh fruits and vegetables have led to scurvy. Your passports are expired, you have no cash and almost 3,000 miles to go before reaching the west coast of the United States. Any of the situations above would comprise a hellish scenario and tax the wildest imagination. But reality sometimes puts fiction to shame.<br /><br />In 1973, Chuck and Dawn Wilcox and their two children ignored the advice of friends and relatives, abandoned the comforts of home, bought a modest sailboat and set off on a quest to sail around the world—a goal which they eventually achieved, The Wilcox family witnessed incredible sights and had experiences that most of us only fantasize about but their adventure also came at a tremendous financial and emotional price. Their saga has been skillfully and masterfully reconstructed more than 40 years later in “Sea Trials,” the remarkable account of the Wilcox’s journey. Author Wendy Hinman weaves together an unforgettable tapestry of excitement and elation, perseverance and disappointment in her telling of the true story of how the Wilcox family survived as they pushed themselves to the limit for five years on the high seas.<br /><br />“Sea Trials” was carefully assembled from letters and logs, scrapbooks and photos, personal interviews and conversations. Garth Wilcox, the author’s husband, is the older of the two Wilcox children who made the trip with his family. He was only a teen-ager at the time, but his vivid memories and recollections also proved to be a rich source of information for the book.<br /><br />As an armchair voyager, I was glad the chapters are short; each is so riveting that I had to put the book down and take a deep breath after every few pages! The writing is lucid and compelling, the pacing effective, and the author’s attention to every detail makes this a truly memorable read.";1539542371641;Truth is stranger than fiction;AGJ7ELJVZHYQZ2H3OMWOPWZWSFTQ;True

156970208X;0;156970208X;2.0;"I keep thinking that Hideyuki Kikuchi is such a popular author, he must have written something of value, but maybe there’s some kind of orientalism going on there. R. A. Salvatore is a wildly popular Western fantasy author, and he’s lousy; why should Hideyuki Kikuchi be any different?<br /><br />This is a compilation of two novels, Demon City Shinjuku and Demon Palace Babylon. It’s hardly “complete,” but these are the only books in the broader series starring Kyoya and Sayaka.<br /><br />Demon City Shinjuku<br />Hideyuki Kikuchi’s first novel. In the far future of 2030, the evil wizard Rebi Ra has cast a death curse on the president of the world as part of a scheme to summon … Satan, possibly? Details are initially murky, but only repulsive teenager Kyoya Izayoi, whose late father trained with Rebi Ra back in the day, can kill Ra and save the day. Rebi Ra is hiding out in Shinjuku; formerly a ward of Tokyo. Shinjuku was devastated by an earthquake, and when supernatural phenomena stopped it from being rebuilt, it eventually morphed into a wildly over-the-top fantasy Mad Max hellscape, full of demons, gangs, ghosts, cyborgs, espers (how long was it after playing Final Fantasy 6 that I realized “esper” came from “ESP-er?” In fairness to me, that’s not what they are in the game) and other badness.<br /><br />As heroes go, Kyoya is pretty dismal. He’s based on a very specific Shonen manga archetype, the super-powered teenager who constantly gropes woman and openly discusses their breast size in front of them but it’s good and cool and funny, actually. He constantly deflates what should be tense situations with insipid wanna-be witticisms, and is generally unpleasant to be around. He becomes slightly less obnoxious in the second half of the novel, but the result is a kind of vague, generically heroic character with little to make him interesting. The costar/romantic interest is the president’s daughter Sayaka. You know the Madonna/whore dichotomy? She’s the Madonna. But her sincerity is a pleasant contrast to Kyoya; there’s a scene where an angry ghost has been murdering people, and she is able to show him compassion and allow him to move on, that’s the closest the book ever comes to being emotionally resonant.<br /><br />Occasionally, the writing is bad in kind of amusing ways. In the prologue, while Kikuchi is describing the Shinjuku earthquake, we get: “The night clubbers wandering down Shinjuku Avenue didn’t have a chance … they were thrown dozens of feet into the air. And then hurling to the ground like trampoline artists missing their marks before they knew what had happened.” Putting aside the weird grammar, the image of an earthquake physically launching people twenty feet into the air is a comedy bit; imagine if you animated this scene, or made a live-action adaption. But the surrounding text makes it clear we’re supposed to be taking this seriously.<br /><br />For the most part, unfortunately, the writing is bad in more banal ways. Or the localization, or both. Picking a few examples, with the understanding that this isn’t close to being exhaustive:<br /><br />1. When Kyoya and Ra first fight, Kyoya is getting the upper hand, but Ra uses his magic to fly into the air and declares: “Luck was on your side, boy. You’ll have to die another day. Or is that all you’ve got?” Then he tries to run away. The first two sentences are clear enough; Kyoya was only winning due to luck, and Ra will kill him later. But what on earth is that third sentence doing? It starts with “or” meaning it should be related to what came before it in a pretty specific way, and it isn’t. These feel like they’re in the wrong order. Move the last sentence around and you get something a lot more coherent: “Is that all you’ve got? Luck was on your side, boy.” i.e. Kyoya’s weak, but got lucky. And then, as he’s running away: “You’ll have to die another day.” I wouldn’t call that good dialogue, but at least it’s base-line coherent.<br /><br />2. “The darkness began to lighten in the direction of the exits. Even the morning eventually visited Demon City.” ‘Even the morning?’ What the novel is trying to say is ‘Even in Demon City, the morning eventually comes’ or something like that.<br /><br />3. “That guy had bad luck written all over him.” If someone has “bad news” written all over him, it means he’s obviously bad news. In general, if someone has “rich” or “sucker” or whatever written all over him, it means he visibly possesses that quality. What the book is trying to say (I think?) is that the guy in question is so obviously dangerous, that meeting him is bad luck, but that’s not at all how that phrase works.<br /><br />4. Kyoya is fighting a vengeful spirit on a motorcycle: “In the moment that the tires were about to roll over him, he sprang vertically with all his might … the ghost rider should have sailed over him, done a one-eighty, and landed on his head.” Really? Because it sure sounded like Kyoya was jumping over the ghost, which should therefore have passed under him. If the implication is that his vertical spring is occurring physically under the motorcycle with the intention of lifting it into the air, that doesn’t come through at all.<br /><br />There are snippets of things to praise about this book. I mentioned that Sayaka had some good scenes (although honestly, calling them “good” is some kind of literary Stockholm syndrome; if those scenes appeared in a better novel, I would be a lost less impressed by them). My inner sixteen-year-old liked some of the Shounen action stuff (it made my list of shame, but the fight against Brand X Ghost Rider was pretty fun). And I do love the basic premise of a ruined, demon-haunted city where people are still just trying to get by. But it’s pretty poor overall; let’s see if the sequel can do better.<br /><br />Demon Palace Babylon<br />Maybe that last novel just beat down my standards, but I did like this more. It’s still badly written; let’s get that out of the way. It’s badly written in basically the same way as the first novel, so I won’t dwell on it. Here’s one example: “Hungry wolves … prowled around, growling in their throats and sniffing the air. And yet they didn’t once dare bite. It was like Kyoya didn’t exist there. Or rather, that his presence meant more to them than the trees or the stones.” What a weird trio of sentences; would you say that wolves “don’t dare to bite” trees and stones?<br /><br />So what do I like about it, in comparison to the first book? The plot is a lot more personal, for starters. In the first book, Kyoya went to Demon City to kill the evil sorcerer basically because he’s a Shonen protagonist; his dad and the bad guy were enemies, but Kyoya had to fight the bad guy less because he seemed to care about his dad’s history, and more out of pure narrative convention. Sayaka wanted to save her dad’s life, presumably, but somehow that never really came up; she didn’t cry at the thought of him dying, or talk about happy memories she had growing up, or do any of the things you might expect a girl in her position to do. In Demon Palace Babylon, the enemy’s plan hinges directly around Sayaka. Maybe there are things to be said about the damsel in distress trope, but Kyoya cares that the girl he’s in love with is in danger, Sayaka cares about not being possessed by her malevolent pre-incarnation, Queen Simiramis, and tritagonist Doctor Mephisto has some sort of romantic history with said queen. They’re meaningfully invested in the conflict in ways that nobody was in Demon City.<br /><br />At the same time, the characters are a lot more likable in this novel. In Demon City Shinjuku, when he sees a girl in tears because a demon is after her, Kyoko reacts by making comments about the size of her breasts. In Demon Palace Babylon, Kikuchi seems to have realized that having his character be the absolute worst is off-putting, because he’s significantly dialed back on that sort of thing; Kyoya is maybe a little bland, but that’s an improvement over what he was before. He’s also helped as a character by the introduction of Doctor Mephisto; they don’t interact as much as I’d have liked, but after the first novel was so desperate to set him up as The Most Powerful Person On The Planet, who alone can save the president and also the world, it’s definitely good for him to have a peer who can act as his equal, and not be constantly impressed by him. Meanwhile, Sayaka is still the Madonna, but the narration is perhaps a little more willing to let her actions speak for themselves, instead of breathlessly telling us how wonderful she is.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the story structure is weak. Midway through, Kyoya goes off to have an anime training arc, which happens totally offscreen; and Doctor Mephisto and Sayaka are hanging out in Babylon for unclear reasons while the bad guy tries to summon Simiramis, which also mostly happens off-screen. Nothing builds to anything, they all just kind of hang out until suddenly it’s time for a big dumb anime battle. And it’s actually clearly worse than the first novel in at least one way, which is that Kyoya and Mephisto effortless wreck the bad guys in the final fight; throw a little tension into your novels, man, I promise you can let your characters be on the back foot and people will still think they're cool.";1684472055073;Lousy localization, but let's be real, this was crap even in the original Japanese;AFTCC2OJGLEBMAVC55Q65XE7IUKA;False

B01MZ8FENX;0;B01MZ8FENX;4.0;Haydn Wilks has developed as a writer since penning The Death of Danny Daggers. Cold Calling offers up a much more focused plot and a provocative story and conclusion.<br /><br />The main character, Rhys Davies, is well developed as a young call center phone jockey who faces constant rejection from his prospects, and then goes home to plug into the world wide web as a typical cowardly troll and as an active participant in internet porn. No surprisingly, Davies is empty and unfulfilled in the soul-killing activities he's chosen and the job that seems to eat away at his spirit day by day.<br /><br />Davies is an island. He doesn't share any camaraderie with his office mates, is at constant odds with the quota-driven supervisors he answers to, and barely tolerates his house mates. He lives almost entirely in his head - which, I've heard it be said, is a very dangerous neighborhood.<br /><br />When he finally snaps - because what else CAN he do - he finds relieve and takes strength in one of the most disturbing, tabu acts imaginable. But why? Why did the act give him a new, on-top-of-the-world feeling? What was it about his victims that gave him what he needed?<br /><br />Haydn Wilks gives us a brutal and biting look at a dirty corner of modern life. In the vein of Brett Easton Ellis and perhaps even Irvine Welsh, he illustrates how empty life today can be and gives us a very polished - albeit disturbing - story.;1486932637000;Polished, albeit disturbing story;AFH642YTK5FSY6J5VEBAPI25R6YQ;True

067460542X;3;067460542X;5.0;"Since 1962, when Rachel Carson published her seminal work, Silent Spring, nothing much has changed in our practice of pest control. Carson had advocated that the methods we employ for pest control must be such that they do not destroy us along with the insects. Yet today, despite the lip service we pay to Silent Spring, and in spite of considerable environmental protest, public outcry and the availability of viable alternatives, we still choose to spray chemical pesticides at an alarming rate. In fact, chemical pesticides still remain our pest control method of choice.<br />Our attitude is to approach pests as organisms to control rather than manage; we exterminate instead of reduce; we dominate rather than learn to accommodate. Why this sad state of affairs remains so is a central theme of this book, which introduces the concept of pest management (as opposed to pest control). Pest management forces us to look beyond the immediate benefits and disadvantages, costs and side effects, of pest control methods towards choosing alternatives that are more environmentally compatible and less harmful to our own health. The author explores scientifically exciting alternative technologies such as biological control, yet admits, as the 1990 gypsy moth invasion of Vancouver has shown, that the public needs more education and assurance on its safety and environmental correctness.<br />This book provides such an education and forms the basis for novel biologically based strategies involving pheromones, parasitic insects, bio-engineered crops and pest diseases to become standard practice.<br />Mark L. Winston is professor of biological sciences at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, Canada. He is the author of two previous books, The Biology of the Honey Bee and Killer Bees.";969795432000;Advocates Pest Management via Biological Control;AGFUJVTDGC3RKXICLOPZ3SIOCV7A;False

0738203483;141;0738203483;3.0;"Having spent the better part of the last 12 years on a virtual A(tenolol)to Z(oloft) tour of drugs prescribed to treat my symptoms of low self-esteem, generalized and social anxiety, and depression, I began to suspect these pretty, candy-like pills--so quickly prescribed interchangeably by psychiatrists and GP's alike--were not only affecting me in the short-term, but also manifesting long-term (if not permanent!) changes in my body--most notably a reduction in sex drive and function and excessive sweating--all without an appreciable, lasting reduction in my original symptoms.  Therefore, when I stumbled across this book on Amazon.com, I was intrigued; what I found in it's pages left me with mixed feelings of horror, relief, knowing, and suspicion.  Not only did I recognize the myriad of side-effects and withdrawal symptoms from my own experience, but Drs. Breggin and Cohen portrayed with uncanny accuracy my attempts at enlisting the help of practitioners unwilling to comply with my wishes to de-medicate.  Too many times I have entered my psychiatrist's office ready to reduce, if not eliminate, the amount of medications I take, only to emerge twenty minutes later with a prescription for an ADDITIONAL drug, often with the intent to treat the side-effects of the first!  This book has given me additional tools and strategies with which to broach the subject at my next appointment.  Am I afraid of the probable return of the original emotional difficulties that brought me there in the first place?  Absolutely.  Am I dreading the all-too-familiar onslaught of dizziness, nausea, restless legs, headaches, depression, and intense emotional suffering that accompanies withdrawal?  No question.  But I am tired of the endless stream of side-effects and general numbing I experience on each successive drug, which inevitably stops working within a few months only to be replaced by something ""better"".  I'm tired of being afraid of my doctor's disapproval, my mental ""illness"", and of living.<br /><br />All this having been said, it's only fair to point out some of the obvious flaws of this book.  As mentioned in previous reviews, it is repetitive in places, oddly devoid of any sense of actual experience with emotional suffering, and conspicuously one-sided.  To claim that ""the degree to which we suffer indicates the degree to which we are alive"" is laughably new-agey and useless in a real-world context.  Try sharing that bit of fluff with the person so deep in a depression that they can't get out of bed, can't care for themselves or their kids--indeed, can't even cry--and see how it is received.  Also, the section on reducing your medications is a bit difficult (even dangerous) to follow if your medication comes in capsule form.  Their suggestion that a capsule be opened and its contents separated into smaller doses isn't very helpful--how do you administer the smaller dosages?  Couldn't it be risky?  All in all, the weakest section of the book is Chapter 13, entitled ""Psychological Principles for Helping Yourself and Others Without Resort to Psychiatric Medications"". It's rife with mindless psychobabble, offering far too many pat fortune-cookie suggestions without any substantive plan for action.  Most disburbingly, Breggin & Cohen tread a dangerous line by zealously condemning ALL use of psychiatric medications (all the while assuring the reader that they don't blame the user).  Surely every schizophrenic or bipolar person (and their loved ones) won't find solace in the simple realization ""that emotional crises and suffering are opportunities for accelerated personal growth"" (p210), nor by focusing ""on finding a rational, loving, and confident center in yourself that can rise above your emotional crisis or suffering"" (p205).  Common sense would suggest that sometimes, for some people, a medication can be the sanest, if not the only answer.<br /><br />At any rate, this book provides a welcome counterpoint to a nation blindly medicating their children into conformity, eagerly requesting prescriptions for psychotropic drugs they see advertised during ""Survivor"", and assigning a convenient DSM label (with the inevitable, corresponding ""miracle"" pill) for every emotional fluctuation.  In itself, ""Your Drug May Be Your Problem"" is best regarded as a jumping-off place for further research rather than the end of the line.";1074116082000;Eye-opening counterpoint to our love affair with happy pills;AEAW4RH3KLR7FPLEPU2K2AUIDWVQ;False

076459902X;165;076459902X;5.0;"I love this book because I am incompetent with vehicles.<br />I know how to fill up my gas tank. I know how to pop my hood. I know the check engine light coming on is bad. Literally, that is the extent to my car knowledge.<br /><br />I don't know how to change a tire. I struggled to pop hoods. I have no clue what a radiator looks like, or even what it does. My father worked on vehicles when he was younger but never taught his children about vehicles; he did all the work for us. I always took my car to the local quick change to get my oil change. I have relied on everyone else to take care of my vehicle for me, and I have to trust their judgment and what they ask to fix my vehicles.<br /><br />I am an analyzer. I analyze numbers and trends. I have great business skills, am technologically advanced and can type 117 words a minute. I have two Master Degrees and am working toward my PhD. I am confident in what I know. And what I know, is I don't know a blasted thing about vehicles in any form, and that aggravates the snot out of me.<br /><br />I was having problems with the battery in my truck a few weeks ago; it was just not getting enough juice to start. I would did everything I knew to do (see aforementioned) and had people come examine it to no avail. Some days it would start and other days it wouldn't. I was on my lunch break when my truck died, again. I couldn't get back to work. I called my supervisor and she sent one of my co-workers (very capable with auto-mechanics) to come take a look. He opened my hood looked at the battery and said ""your clamp is loose, that's why your not getting any power."" I looked at him dumbfounded. What's a clamp? He then took a screwdriver, unscrewed something, and pushed a little on this thingymajig called a clamp.<br /><br />The truck started.<br /><br />I decided that was the last straw.<br /><br />Something so simple made me late and affected my job performance. If I knew the basics about vehicles I could have gotten my truck started. I didn't and I didn't.<br />I went to work in a foul mood, determined to learn auto-mechanics. I searched amazon, found this book, and knew it was for me.<br /><br />Since that time:<br />I can change my oil. I take care of all the fluids. I can change all tires, check the gauges, coolants, anything basic. I have decided I am going to take an auto-mechanic class at the local community college. I also want to build a little garage some day, and start small repairs on my own vehicles. I would genuinely like to take a clunker and fix it with the time I don't have.<br /><br />You can be like this too! I knew absolutely nothing about vehicles! This manual will teach you how to pop open your hood and fill up your gas tank. We laugh at this, but some people genuinely don't know how to do this. My wife didn't when we wed. Fear not; we all have to start somewhere! The manual gives detailed descriptions and accurate, simple pictures of everything you can do without seeing a mechanic for a serious problem. And the book will even elaborate when you may be doing something out of your league. Time to pony up and call the mechanic!<br /><br />Your car should be your best friend. It takes you wherever you need to go and you pray it starts up every morning. Why not take care of it? Not to mention, if you do your own small maintenance repairs starting now until the rest of your life, you could very well save a lot of money. Plus, it's satisfying to look at your vehicle, knowing you have accomplished.<br /><br />If you have basic skills (typing, can change a lightbulb, count to 100, know how to breathe) but don't know the first thing about a vehicle, this book is for you. I believe the book should spark interest and give a desire to learn about vehicles, teaching how to take care of them while saving the reader money.<br /><br />I believe the investment is worth it. And hey, perhaps the cost of the book will be far less than the mechanics hourly rate of fixing your car. I am inclined to think such is probably true in most circumstances. But I could be wrong.

The first and second were definitely freshman and sophmore affairs, but there was such great promise in them, and they were so enjoyable I bought the third, which utterly hooked me. Now with this fourth installment of the October Daye series, McGuire has a solid fan. I love the pacing, breakneck, then pause, then up and running again. I feel like I'm watching an action move, but I actually care what happens. The fact that she can craft characters I not only remember but care about, who also DEVELOP over the course of the series shows the strength of her writing. Also, I like the love story subplot, its delightfully tense, I love it, but I'm not annoyed. Neither of them is swooning over the other, or whining incessantly about it, nor is the author building up to something over and over again only to throw a ridiculous plot point in just to be contrary.<br /><br />All in all, I just enjoyed the whole thing, loved it in fact.

In the guise of a crime story, a noir really, LoPresti gives us a grippingly honest and relatable meditation on the question, “Why live?”<br /><br />Our lead, holed up in an out-of-the-way, 1-star motel after a job gone wrong, must navigate his grief over his dead wife and his responsibility toward his living daughter, his impulses toward self-harm and suicide, a suspiciously available beauty, and the bad guys he works for as well as bad guys he doesn’t work for. LoPresti masterfully balances the inner and outer catastrophes, the tensions and realizations, the mysteries and the reveals.

What a wonderful basis for a story and a ""windfall"", but what a terrible way to needlessly dig up the past!<br /><br />Junger wants to place in the reader's mind a question of who the murderer of Bessie Goldberg is........Roy Smith, a worker sent by a Boston agency to clean her home, or DeSalvo, a suspect in the Boston stranglings taking place at that time.......However, it is a fact that Smith was convicted based on evidence that clearly marked him as guilty.  It is impossible to understand how anyone else could have been involved in this tragic event, but Junger leads the reader to suspect differently.  Many of the book's facts are based on his embellishments and a stretch of his imagination.  It is written in a sophomoric style.

The book starts with author's musings on why server-side responsiveness is the way to go and offers an analysis of page load performance of various popular websites. Some very good points are raised here and I was surprised to see that most responsive pages are significantly more expensive byte-wise when rendered on mobile as when rendered on desktop. For me, this was the most valuable part of the book, along with the section on measuring and validating page load time in CI. The rest of the book is obviously intended for absolute beginners and provides gentle introduction to various parts of the process that begins with typing the URL in the browser and ends with an interactive website (such as establishing TCP connection, HTTP protocol, caching, etc.). Note that all of this just scratches the surface and provides a reference to where to look next. In the final part of the book some responsive (client-side!) frameworks (bootstrap et al.) are compared and author presents his server-side responsive solution, but he doesn't offer much explanation or discussion and I found his design very weird. Overall, the book is very short (152 pages) and is littered with pointless figures and charts. On the plus side, it reads like a breeze.

And I'm happy to report that it's just as lovely as I imagined it would be. A story of God's redemption and His light in dark places, ""Once I Knew"" shines with the hope of the Savior. There's romance, a bit of political intrigue, wonderful family and friend bonds, and an ending that is satisfactory but still holds the promise of more.<br /><br />Was it the most unique book I've ever read? No. But I didn't expect or need it to be. I walked in expecting my heart to be touched, and it delivered. It's a lovely story, but it doesn't shy away from hard and heavy topics (some things to be aware of: the loss of parents, some violence, innuendo and general grossness from some evil people, and Violet's grandmother suffers with dementia). While I do love a magical story, I still enjoyed this magic-less world. It hearkened back to the books of my childhood, and I loved it for that.<br /><br />I loved the characters; Violet, who is so strong but allowed to be feminine at the same time, Obed, who doesn't know who he is and finds God's grace through that loss, Granny, who I just wanted to hug throughout the whole story.

0684836696;3;0684836696;3.0;"Many would criticize McWhorter's book as being anecdotal, which it largely is -- but it should be understood as an extended essay rather than a sociological study.  That said, in its own terms it often misuses information or misrepresents issues; overall, its analysis in my view is very wrongly directed.<br />  Two examples of mis-argumentation are illustrative:  first, in trying to make the simply inaccurate claim that the gap between the races has mostly closed, he confronts one of the key statistics -- that the median income for blacks in America is approximately 61% that of whites.  This figure has risen (in the 1990s) and fallen (in the '80s, and since the book was published) but since 1970 has probably risen less than 5%.  At that rate it would take 300 years to achieve parity.  Faced with this gaping problem, he evades the issue by emphasizing that many misconstrue the statistic as meaning that blacks in identical jobs as whites are only paid 61% as much, which misunderstanding in a country where 40% of the general public think that Saddam Hussein was linked to 9/11 isn't surprising.  But this handling of data deftly avoids the real meaning of the statistic, which shows his whole argument in that section of the book, that only remnants of social inequality remain, is bogus.<br />  Second, after taking a series of atrocity stories to try to discredit the wide range of views to the left of his hero Shelby Steele, he has a chapter entitled &quot;How to Save the Black Race&quot; devoted largely to the abolition of affirmative action.  Now there are conservative blacks (and the Harvard Law School prof that he criticizes for saying that there's gold in such advocacy for blacks in academe is right on the money) who argue against affirmative action, but NONE that I know of would claim that it is the primary or even a primary solution to the issues facing blacks in the US.<br />  On the positive side, McWhorter's anecdotes are sometimes instructive, such as his compelling review of the political correctness slant of the &quot;ebonics&quot; debate, or the Bolivian woman who was reduced to tears in a class for daring to criticize misogyny in rap (something I know a number of people with what could be termed the social 'credentials' who would also abhor).  As an activist on the left for over a quarter of a century, I know that there is much one has to slog through, even where the movement on the overall issue is right; such things need to be highlighted and criticized, but unfortunately, McWhorter, by linking these points to a larger deeply flawed reasoning and characterization of progressive black politics tends to lend intrinsic as opposed to engineered or imposed discredit to these valid, if hardly overriding, points.<br />  One last observation.  After spending over 15 years of my life in and around both Harvard and Berkeley Universities, including as a reader of undergraduates' papers at Berkeley in the early 1980's, I noticed a HUGE gulf between Harvard undergraduate and Berkeley graduate student culture on one hand, and Berkeley undergraduates on the other.  The various disparaging remarks about black students from Bernie Davis at Harvard and others one hears about notwithstanding, blacks at Harvard or in the graduate schools were, like whites in those schools, much more intellectually oriented than the undergraduates at Berkeley generally.  Admittedly my experience is limited, but the 'anecdotal' evidence here points to a pattern that does not fall along racial lines, as is central to McWhorter's argument, but along institutional lines.<br />  Overall, McWhorter's book is a possible source of an interesting story or point here and there, but any way you slice it the argument overall is uncompelling to a close reader.";1060417336000;agenda-driven analysis with some interesting observations;AGTYH35RJN7LEKANN6XECVH75TUA;False

Weiler Hogan's fictional town of Riverville, California, is a thinly disguised version of Guerneville, on the Russian River in Sonoma County, a real-life popular gay resort for prosperous San Franciscans and a longtime funky hippy town for locals that also draws regional tourists.<br /><br />Until Further Notice begins with a young Oklahoman who arrives in town ambitious to be a real California girl. She's picked Riverville because the male-female ratio seems promising, but something deeper must be calling her, because Nancy fits in immediately with the quirky culture of her new home. With the promise of a waitress job her first day in town, she signs a lease for a studio in the Smoke Hill Cottages, where the population of eccentrics makes a lively and endearing cast for Hogan's story and Nan's orientation to Riverville life.<br /><br />Hogan's chapters are punctuated with messages from the cottage's general manager. Their tone and topics provide Nan with further material for her reports to her friend Emma, back in Oklahoma, and for her conversations with other residents, including gay Tennessean Adam, certifiable and litigious Evonna, troublemaking little Bobby and his rescuer, Mrs. Carmichael, and Nan's co-worker at the restaurant, Peter, with his challenging living arrangements, among others.<br /><br />Nan finds a boyfriend, hosts a visit from Emma, and gradually finds her place in the Riverville community, participating in the venerable and frequent celebrations of parades and fireworks, parties and talent nights. By the end of the book she's realized, as she tells Emma, that ""Being a California girl doesn't have anything to do with where you actually live.""<br /><br />Until Further Notice is a charming book whose appeal is increased by Sandra Maresca's inviting colored pencil cover illustration. Locals and former residents will find it a treasure. Visitors will find much to appreciate as well, and California wannabes will doubtless be further inspired to visit promptly and settle in soon to the real-life version of Hogan's delightfully realized world.

1534449590;33;1534449590;1.0;"I came on here to see what people were thinking about this awful collection. Even those who like this book must be able to see that is one poorly written identity-based political statement after another, thinly disguised as stories.<br />Now, there's nothing wrong with stories taking a certain viewpoint and an author using that story to push a certain worldview, but the stories picked for this volume use the sledgehammer approach, with no subtlety or literary quality to almost any story in this book.  It is one poorly written, mediocre screed after another.<br /><br /> If a writer wants to make a point, they need to do so within the confines of a well-thought out story, one that's entertaining, with developed characters!  Growing up reading New Wave SF of the 60's I'm certainly used to and OK with, heck I know going in it's coming, a left-leaning world view.  But the great writers of SF know how to couch their messages inside of a great story......not these authors!  This was like reading the winners of an amateur writing contest, or an ""L. Ron Hubbard Presents Writers of the Future"" anthology.<br /><br />I'd sum it up like this:  The stories in this book did not start out as creative impulses to write a beautiful story using SF tropes to entertain, and along the way maybe educate, an audience.  They almost all very obviously started out backwards, first with the thought of some political idea that the writer (I can't say 'author'!) decided they needed to impart in their wisdom to an audience that needs to be educated, and THEN had a weak, thin ""story"" built around those ideas.<br />I won't buy anything in this series again.  The editor quite obviously chooses stories not on quality, but on the writers' identities, cultural backgrounds, and personal beliefs.  Strahan stretches and stretches to try to be 'inclusive' and include stories from so many different cultures, but doesn't realize that this hinders, not helps, authors from around the world.  Choose the best stories, period!  Don't force a quota of ''cultural inclusiveness' so that stories of less quality are included.<br />It's called ""The Year's Best Science Fiction.""  That's it.  Not<br />""The World's Most Inclusive, Look at Me, I'm a Guilty White Dude but I'm Woke, See All the Colors of the Rainbow I Included! Collection""<br /><br />Also, I can save anyone on the fence about this book the trouble.  In case you didn't know it:<br />1) Rich people are bad! Evil!  And if they're rich and white, oh my, kill 'em! (Really.  In one story a crowd tears apart a rich family w/KIDS at an airport......)<br />2) Global warming! Did you know it's coming!  We're all going to be drowned soon!<br />3) Did you know we should take care of ecology and Nature?  Yes, it's true!  Simplistic and a golden oldie of a story idea in SF, but in case you didn't catch the news, you will be informed herein.<br />4) Oh, and who's at fault for all that bad stuff? Rich White People, of course, dummy.<br />5) Did I mention Global Warming?  We'll all be drowned soon!<br /><br />{For the record I have no doubt the warming is real, but as to what extent, and if it's truly going to be as disastrous as some make it out to be, that's up in the air.  Color me skeptical based on the fact that I've read this ""End is Nigh!' stuff in SF since the 70's, yet somehow we all move on.  Add in where the funding for the science comes from, and a  LOT of scientific bias, and I have a feeling there'll be problems but not nearly as apocalyptic as many warn.}<br /><br />Most disappointing were the terrible stories included from who are usually great writers: Elizabeth Bear, Ted Chiang, and Greg Egan.  As the most recognizable names here, I was looking forward to some quality finally, but their stories flop, especially Chiang's, which is not even a story but more of a lecture.  He's probably the greatest SF writer of the last 20 years, but just drops a lecture about Evil Rich People on us.<br /><br />There are a few good stories here.<br />Out of 28 stories<br />(a lot-----apparently Strahan doesn't believe in longer forms which would allow more character and plot development---the better to squeeze in a few more authors from some underrepresented population, you see.........)<br />I can say that 6 were pretty good.<br /><br /> In order appearance:<br />""The Last Voyage of 'Skidbladnir' was well-written and had some style, although the story ends without much development.  A Good Idea that has nowhere to go.<br />""""A Catalog of Storms"" had a mood and certain intriguing style.  Unfortunately, the author didn't really know where to go with what was an interesting concept.<br />'The Robots of Eden"" succesfully used a SF trope to make a good point about where exactly we are heading w/technology.  Irritating for the first few pages with unlikeable characters, it grows and expands and ends well, as the narrator/tion takes an interesting turn.<br />""Now Wait for This Week"" was a fun take on Groundhog Day.  I'm not sure it went anywhere or had much point, but I enjoyed it.<br />""The Work of Wolves"" is similar to ""Robots"" in that it also relies on the use of the narrator for effect, and at 31 pages is the second longest in the book, not surprisingly also being one of the best, and definitely the most developed story here.  It is an example of how his over-reliance on short, short stories hurts this collection, as they are limited in terms of plot/character by the page/word count.  (They're called novellettes and novellas, Mr. Strahan!).<br />And again not surprisingly, the longest story at 32 pages, ""At the Fall"" which had a great idea, although it was filled w/holes and needed another 10 pages or so to fill it out.  Great idea for a story, though.  Dud of an ending, however.<br /><br />So there you have it.  A few decent stories, but mostly amateurish and preachy.<br /> For Dozois-lovers, try this if you want, but it'll leave you frustrated and missing the standard of literary quality Gardner upheld; if you're a woke Millennial or Guilty White Person or just love being told how and what to think you may enjoy all the preaching; if you prefer your SF short, warmed over, with little depth and development, hey!, maybe this collection is for you.<br /><br />However, if you enjoy adult, sophisticated, literary stories with well-developed characters, depth of plot, and ones that use SF tropes to examine the human condition, save your money!<br /><br />I'm reading through my collection of Mr. Dozois's yearly series, and am on  #15 from 2000.  His Intro alone is more interesting than this entire book.  I'm looking forward to rereading all of them.";1606182675715;NOT on the level of Dozois's annual collections/Too concerned with 'inclusion' over literary quality;AFIWBAKHNNHFWOOWQY2EY7QJDB4A;True

Every church should be on mission with Christ, a light to our surrounding world.  Every. Church.  This book is not about how to build a mega-church reflecting that of the author's own experience.  It is a book about health and purpose.  There is a premise here though, ""If you pursue health, growth will be a naturally occurring by-product."" (See Psalm 1:1 - 3)<br /><br />Before the introduction begins, there are several pages of endorsements from many of our nation's leading pastors.  Here's what just one has to say about The Blessed Church:<br /><br />""Our world desperately needs healthy, vibrant churches, so I'm so thankful Robert Morris has written The Blessed Church--a book that draws on the Gateway `back story' to describe the qualities of a healthy local church. More than anything, a heart for God and a love of people define the ministry of Pastor Morris and Gateway Church. If you want a growing vitality in your church, you will profit from every page of The Blessed Church.""  --Chris Hodges, senior pastor, Church of the Highlands<br /><br />The book starts by examining the importance of vision.  Proverbs 29:18 says, ""Where there is no vision, the people perish..."" It all starts with vision.  That vision pulls you in the direction you're heading. Just like all successful endeavors, there is first inspiration, the idea of what could be, the driving force...But remember, this is God's story, not our own. So first and foremost, we must seek Him.<br /><br />The book is effectively broken into these sections:<br /><br />Blessed Vision<br />Blessed Shepherds<br />Blessed Leaders<br />Blessed Government<br />Blessed Church Culture<br /><br />Scattered throughout the book are a myriad of wise nuggets to think about.  They are aptly named, Keys to a Blessed Church.  Here are a few of my favorites, which can easily be applied to the life of any follower of Christ, not just church leadership:<br /><br />""When faced with a major decision or challenge, don't make a move without first getting alone with God and obtaining His counsel."" (Reference Psalm 119:105)<br /><br />""When you let the Holy Spirit paint a vision upon the canvas of your heart, a picture will emerge that will stagger your imagination and test your faith.  If the vision doesn't seem impossible to accomplish with your natural ability, it's probably not from God.""  (Reference Exodus 3:11)<br /><br />And how about this one:<br /><br />""What spiritual injustice bothers you most? Righting a wrong is a key to your vision for ministry.""  (Reference: Psalm 39:2-3)<br /><br />So while the target audience for The Blessed Church is undoubtedly pastors and lay- leaders, I think anyone can walk away with applicable truths to encourage spiritual growth.";1368023520000;Healthy Things Grow!;AEZBM3KQYSP2QWKUGEUVXWVM4ATA;False

1931882088;14;1931882088;2.0;"From ethic historiography, sometimes to A point of incorporating elements from fictional literary devices describing entirely imaginary cultures. More commonly, however, elements are appropriated from a rapid process of reinterpretation and change that  transformed  `exotic' occurrences or beliefs, into an organic part of the new context.<br /><br />Writers will attempt to stress continuity and disregard change, a legitimizing process that has its typical elements. For example what in the `syndrome' Matrix is termed  reduction, is used  to denote several related techniques of reducing the complexity, variety and contextuality of the traditions or situations from which elements are taken. Thus, `The Truth behind its Templar and Masonic secrets' esoteric, understandings of actually existing  traditions, e.g. Gnostics, the kabbala or Freemasonry, are radically pared-back versions of the originals, see([...] ).<br /><br />The complexities of the Jewish kabbala, with its numerous schools, its arcane texts and its path of religious instruction stretching over many years, is reduced to a New Age / Da Vinci Code Syndrome kabbala, a  system of correspondences that now can be explained in a 'slender' best selling volume.<br /><br />An influential presentation of the doctrine of exoteric versus esoteric religion in the French Occult revival is Edouard Schure's Les Grands Inities, published in 1899 when he was a Theosophist, later he became an admirer of Rudolf Steiner.<br /><br />The distinction made by several writers between an exoteric and an esoteric form of religion combines several topoi common within the Esoteric-alternative milieu. It eliminates the relativism that one risks when facing the diversity of human faiths: behind the many masks of religion lies one single core wisdom. It explains the difference between various exoteric faiths by placing them within the various stages of Esoteric historiography, thus incorporating them into one of the dominating metanarratives of the  Esoteric milieu. It provides a place in the (emic) spiritual history of mankind for the initiates who have transmitted perennial philosophy, always making sure that it is phrased in a language adapted to the needs and abilities of the recipient.<br /><br />But Hindu reincarnation is not the same as kabbalistic reincarnation. Among the kabbalists, Isaac Luria has a very different conception of reincarnation than does the anonymous author of the Zohar. However, a synthesizing Da Vinci Code Syndrome spokesperson intent on finding a perennial (`Gnostic') philosophy underlying  divergent traditions (example `Freemasonry'), has ample material from which to synthesize, and every- opportunity to reduce traditions to the grand scale on which the divergences can come to appear as insignificant details.<br /><br />Typical of the development of Da Vinci Code Syndrome  religiosity is  its eclecticism, where  spokespersons like Dan Brown, attempt to combine the most disparate sources into a personal synthesis.<br /><br />Among elements of this `Matrix' there is pattern recognition , a basic cognitive strategy, also in daily life we often form hypotheses that help us find order and covariation even in random data, and then apply a strategy of selective hypothesis testing to ensure that the existence of the patterns we have projected onto the data will be corroborated.<br /><br />But in the Da Vinci Code Syndrome this then is done by adducing carefully selected and skewed data. Where a more attentive reader might suspect selective reading of the history, myths, and facts  behind such a claim. But considerable effort is spent on showing that these seemingly disparate elements in fact point to the same underlying reality.<br /><br />For example a variety of symbols that may ethically appear to be selected more or less at random from the vast variety of options, can be claimed to be near-universal. I pointed out a few examples of this via symbols in the Da Vinci Code.  Other `Da Vinci Code Syndrome' books  for example have  the cross and the fire are central to traditions ranging from Christianity and Hinduism to alchemy, masonry, Platonism and kabbalism.  Typical  of Da Vinci Code  religiosity is thus its eclecticism.<br /><br />Or another example, ever since Madame Blavatsky's ""Secret Doctrine"", the number seven  serves as a focus of pattern recognition: since many religions contain at least some doctrines describing elements grouped in sevens, they can be proclaimed to be essentially the same. ""Brahmanical religion"" believed in seven inhabited worlds; Egyptian religion believed in the transmigration of souls in seven stages; Mithraism had seven mysteries; several masonic lodges have seven steps. Yet Theosophy and other occult groups today, presents such similarities as due  to a common spiritual heritage.<br /><br />More recently than New Age writers have added that since there are seven metals and, seven planets in Renaissance alchemy, ""in reality"", the alchemists worked with the `chakra' system.<br /><br />When no overt similarities are to be found, correspondences can be forced upon the material. Even though the kabbalistic tree of life bears no obvious resemblance to the chakra system, in various systems of system of `hypnotism' and `inner alchemy' the two are said to be definitely related.<br /><br />Thus Esoteric spokespersons  construct parallels in their attempts to join systems, creating patterns where the outsider sees none.  Crystals were a marginal point of interest in the Esoteric groupings until quite recently.  Esoteric spokespersons such as Madame Blavatsky, Rudolf Steiner, and Alice Bailey, do not mention them.<br /><br />But today authors will frequently claim that ""crystals leads us back to the ancient continent of Atlantis. It is supposed that the evolved inhabitants of this advanced race used crystals to channel and harness the cosmic force.""<br /><br />To give an (esoteric) 'Archeological'  example, last year, Gary A. David claimed a  definite relationships between  the Anasazi Indians of the American Southwest and Europe's Knights Templar. It seems just to obvious  Gary  David  argued that  the Circular buildings  found at Mummy Cave Ruin in Canyon de Chelly (traditional home of the Snake Clan) are no doubt related to the  round towers found in the European during the  middle ages and thus for sure evidence Knights Templar sealed to the America's.<br /><br />Gary David also brought in (even more popular today than one year ago) an alleged  fragment from the Dead Sea Scrolls called The ""Testament of Amram"" where a certain ""Belial"" dreams of a  ""terrifying in appearance, like a serpent..."" and ""his visage [is] like a viper..."" The figure of Belial referenced in II Corinthians 6:15 means ""lawlessness,"" ""worthless,"" or ""reckless"" and is an appellation of Satan. The word ""serpent,"" is synonymous with both the Enochian Watchers and the Nephilim, the latter denoting the ""giants in the earth"" from Genesis 6:4.<br /><br />Gary  David has no difficulty to find  `evidence' to back up his claims by quoting  other esoteric/alternative `experts'. For example Andrew Collins in his `Archeology' and `Ancient History' book- Ashes of Angels (2001) writes (all backed up by similar circumstantial evidence as all, authors quoted above) that the Nephilim are also known as the sons of the Anakim. ""The word Anak is generally taken by Jewish scholars to mean 'long-necked', or 'the men with the necklaces'..."" In this context it is curious that the Hopi term naaqa means ""turquoise necklace"" or ""ear pendant "" and that anaaq means ""ouch!"", an interjection used to express extreme pain, such as that caused by a snakebite. Is this, then, a reference to the Indo-European Nagas, those snake-worshiping seafarers originating from the Indus River Valley? Are these the so-called Long Ears, who stretched their lobes with ear-plugs? Coincidentally, archaeologists found an example of this artifact in an ancient pueblo ruin known as Snaketown near modern-day Phoenix.<br /><br />To intensify the mystery, the word ""Chna,"" an English transliteration of the Greek word referring to the Phoenician land of Canaan, is homophonically similar to Ch'a, the Hopi name for the worshiped snake that initiated their biennial ceremony still performed today on the high desert of Arizona in order to bring rain. The biblical Anakim were known to have hailed from southern Canaan. In addition, Baal, the Phoenician rain god mentioned above, is similar in sound and sense to the Hopi word paal. Did the Phoenicians, the Anasazi in building the round towers, come to the American Southwest and establish outposts there in order to trade with the latter? Were the Knights Templar the recipients of this Naga/Phoenician legacy, carrying forth the ancient traditions bequeathed from Egypt?<br /><br />Specifically, the djed pillar was known as the ""backbone of Osiris."" Morphologically similar to the round towers, this column symbolically channeled the kundalini (serpent energy) up the vertebrae. In Jesus, Last of the Pharaohs (1999), Ralph Ellis avers that round towers were modeled after the Benben tower located in the Phoenix Temple at Heliopolis. (The Phoenicians took their name from the mythical bird that rose from its ashes.) He also says that over 7,000 Nuraghi, or circular towers constructed during the second millennium BC, are found on the island of Sardinia north of the ancient Phoenician city of Carthage (modern-day Tunis).<br /><br />Do these structures form a global network centered around ophidian fertility symbols? To return to our starting point, were the Irish round towers also ""snake houses,"" or phallic temples used by a race of serpent people whom St. Patrick in the 5th century AD ultimately had to chase into the sea? (For case study purposes quoted from: [...])<br /><br />One can see that it would be easy for Gary David to make a trilogy just as worthy as the after all `fictional' novels of the Da Vinci Code, backed by `real quotes', and `direct references' to other, `non-fiction' bestsellers of a `recent' date...<br /><br />Another strategy, closely related to pattern recognition, is synonymization. Whereas pattern recognition rhetorically erases differences between divergent elements of religious praxis and doctrines myth A is essentially the same as myth B, ritual X is merely a version of ritual Y-synonymization wields its homogenizing influence over religious terminology.<br /><br />Synonymization utilizes the curious double role of words in a foreign language interspersed in a text written in e.g. English as seen in the example quoting Gary David. Who like many others no doubt `believes' is what he writes, and clearly is not doing this for profit only, a reason I took his website as an example for quoting what can be seen as common strategies of epistemology  we find all the way from 19th century  Blavatsky, to the most sophisticated of New Age (pseudo-)`scientists'.<br /><br />Amit Goswami in the The Self Aware Universe claims  the same message was proclaimed by mystics as diverse as Catherine of Genoa, Hui-Neng, Ibn al-Arabi, Moses de Leon, Padmasambhava, Eckhart, al-Hallaj, Shankara and Jesus.<br /><br />But why, then, do Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists and Christians disagree on so many issues if the ""essence"" of each religion is identical? Goswami's answer is that ""mysticism is a universal enterprise"".<br /><br />Something hardly any student who completes a PhD today in Religion , History, or /and Sociology, would agree with.<br /><br />But only certain cultures (even the choice is more and more expanding) are part of the matenal on which these writers draw. One might hypothesize that these are cultures that have points of overt affinity with the esoteric-alternative millieu.<br /><br />The double process of selective choice and creative hermeneutics applies apart from mysticisism for the purpose of constructing an inner and as seen in the example quoted from Gary, and alternative-historians or the Da Vinci Code books, is myth.<br /><br />But each tradition referred to nevertheless seems to have its own role in Esoteric historiography. Egypt is the land of initiation, of great mysteries; India is the source of concepts such as reincarnation, karma and the subtle bodies; Tibet plays the role of the homeland of sages and the repository of ancient scriptures. In a sense, however, the distinction between an Egyptian tradition and one based on a generalized India, Europe and the Knights Templar, or even an imaginary one such as the wisdom of Lemuria or the Atlanteans.<br /><br />However neither Egypt, India, Atlantis or Neoplatonism figure in this story as representatives of their respective historical times and geographical locations as they are understood by historians of religion.";1099157786000;Gnostics,  kabbala ,Freemasonry, back versions.;AGDV4RPGDDE56KOLBSVRMIV5OFUA;False

1555976611;5;1555976611;4.0;I heard about this book while listening to NPR on my way to work one morning. I'm a big fan of Nordic noir and this is in much the same vein. It's supposed to be a novel, but it reads more like a memoir. The narrator was born the same year that a serial arsonist hits a small town in rural Norway. He shifts between the presumptive arsonist and his own experiences as an adult. In doing so he shows the similarities between the father/son relationship of both he and his father and the arsonist and his father.<br /><br />As is the case with most Norwegian novels, this one, like those of Jo Nesbø, has been excellently translated by Don Bartlett. The prose is very effortless, but gives the impression of an iceberg: more lies beneath the surface than is visible above it.

Well, I have to say that I was semi-disappointed.  For one thing, if you didn't like Mina in the War of Souls books I don't think this book will do much to change your mind, at least it didn't for me.  In fact, this book has actually made me hate Mina now, I didn't really mind her in the War of Souls books.  Luckily, the book doesn't totally focus on her.  In this book we're also introduced to a shaolin-like monk of Majere, which being asian I would love except for the fact that the character fell into one of my pet peeve, an asian part given to a white actor (in this case a white character).  It's like watching Kung Fu the tv series with a white actor playing a shaolin monk, but at least he's suppose to be Chinese.  However, I don't think most readers would care much about this.  As for the Kender who can talk to the dead, he seems underdevelop and is only there to help the story along.  My favorite character in the book is actually Chemosh, god of the dead, he seems to be the most interesting character in a book full of bland characters with his inner conflict and ambition.  Even Zebiom, goddess of the sea, seemed more interesting than the three main mortal characters.<br /><br />However, given all that I still give the book 4 stars because given all my dislike for the mortal characters I found that I really enjoyed the god characters and their mortal-like struggles.  I also found the storyline entertaining, the reason why I read the book in one night and will probably pick up the second book.

0470592508;8;0470592508;4.0;"There is much to gain from Super Sectors if one has an open mind (investment or trading style-wise) and is willing to employ at least some discipline (risk management, capital preservation). An ""open mind"" is needed for the buy-and-hold (passive investor) types, as well as for those who day trade with minimal success, or who hop around from mutual fund to mutual fund (or stock to stock) after reading the latest edition of whatever magazine. In any of these cases, it's likely that little or no due diligence has been performed and outside of an all-out bull market, one has probably lost money, or perhaps made nominal gains, which will unfortunately be eaten up by commissions. With Nyaradi's most simple trading systems that he introduces, and his more robust, preferred (but still strikingly simple) 5-signal system, one should have a far greater chance of profitably entering and exiting positions. Combining this simple technical analysis with some fundamental analysis as he, I, and others do, should further increase your likelihood success. While admittedly there are parts of the book that feel redundant, that might not be the case for buy-and-old types, for instance, who should understand that there are alternative investment approaches, and in the very least, to consider capital preservation -- e.g. no need to necessarily ride a stock or fund all the way up and back down without taking some profits. In addition, for traders, rather than trade blindly or get bogged down with an overly-complex trading system that one may not adhere to anyway (this is the ""discipline"" factor mentioned above), traders or investors with shorter-term holding periods will benefit also from his simple explanations and his chapters on selling, risk management, psychology. His ""Q&A with the experts"" section makes for a nice closing to the book.

So instead of just learning about the two leading men of a certain era, we also learn who their contemporaries were in industry, finance, art, etc.  Most Americans do not realize for example, that so many people (Presidents, Generals, etc) were contemporaries during other matters/conflicts...that those who shaped the Civil War, and Reconstruction, were around during the Mexican-American War...which also had leaders who were around the same people who formed the Revolution.  There is much overlap, and while reading you are amazed at how Johnson brings this to light, with social and political references, as well as dates and places.<br />He further explains another phenomena (ok, I'm biased here) that is often overlooked.  The role of geography and immigrant group in the &quot;second tier&quot; leadership of the US.  Yes, there were the stereotypical Jeffersons/Washingtons/Adams..of Anglo-Saxon origin running the early US...but behind them were the rugged Scots-Irish &quot;country&quot; (or Southern in many cases) leaders like Jackson, Calhoun, Clay, etc. (or Cyrus McCormick in industry).<br />It is a wonderful book, and provides insight into many areas simply not taught in primary and secondary education.  And contrary to what other reviewers have written, I found it quite DRYLY refers to such politically weighty matters such as the use of the A-bomb.  You simply get references to letters, quotes, and news accounts...in other words, FACTS...NOT his views on the matter.  So I am not sure where that is coming from...he is quite objective about FDR, as he is with every other president.<br />The statistics on industry are enlightening...rail, steel, skyscrapers...you simply don't get this broad of an overview in school...and you certainly don't get the impression that skyscrapers (or their early predecessors I should say) were being built in the late 1800s, while we think of that era as simply the era of the &quot;old West&quot;.<br />Buy this book..it's fascinating.";1070715452000;Excellent overview, drawing contemporary issues together;AEL7Y3KITKQL4VCPA52W6RJTDVOQ;False

In this labor of love, John Biggs takes the reader on a journey through the history of watch making. Along the way we learn about the skill, artistry and science. He weaves in the historical context and we learn about the French Revolution, Marie Antoinette's love affair, and a very special watch made by the world's premiere watch maker. We find out about a theft from a museum and as we follow the queen of all watches, we begin to understand the industry and how it in many ways relates to today's high technology engineers. You'll note parallels between Breguet, the master watch maker and Steve Jobs in their sense of perfection, their devotion to design and their unique ability to take existing technology and make it better. I had no love or understanding of watch making when I picked up this book.

All of their advice and tips were very good about getting me to think about how I wanted to answer the question and what the raters were looking for in terms of a 'good answer'.  However, after taking a sample test with CASPer, I was writing answers that were way too long and detailed for the short time given (only answering 1/3 questions). I then tailored BeMo's approach and limited each response to 3-4 sentences which gave me enough time to answer 2 to 3 questions per scenario. Although you won't receive your score, I feel like this book did a good job of preparing me to write out my thought process in ethical dilemmas.

1479247030;0;1479247030;2.0;I found this book to be slightly interesting.  I didn't think the writing was very engaging.  There were some good parts, especially those that revolved around the sacking of Lawrence.  My major critique concerns the banality of the storytelling.  The book is approximately 200 pages of the same story told over and over again.  Quantrell and his men ride around avoiding union soldiers.  Sometimes they engage the unions soldiers.;1478890222000;There were some good parts, especially those that revolved around the sacking ...;AG5P6NOYOGWWE2Y6XDLCG4E5D6AA;True

Apparently, he has all kinds of great word plays in the original Yiddish that made his readers laugh uproariously.

1940363713;0;1940363713;5.0;I was introduced to Master Sha's healing techniques when his student offered me a healing blessing for my knee.  I was intrigued that I could learn simple techniques to heal myself without going to a doctor, delighted to learn how to boost my energy, stamina, vitality, and immunity, again by using simple practices.  Master Sha has also blessed me with healing for major issues.  Because Master Sha heals from the root cause of the problem or illness, not simply treating the symptoms as Western medicine does, he has also been successful at healing  conditions with no known cures in Western medicine.<br /><br />I have wanted to share the good news about how Master Sha empowers a person with knowledge, brings unedited teachings from the Divine, new wisdom from the Source, but have problems getting past the skepticism barrier.  Therefore, I am grateful that Mr. Gladstone investigates Master Sha and his service for you, dear reader, and helps you to understand that Master Sha has healed many people as a Miracle Soul Healer serving the Divine, the Tao, and Humanity.<br /><br />Open your mind and heart to find out about this very special teacher and powerful healer that is available to you on Mother Earth at this time.

1401952186;0;1401952186;5.0;The Life of Yogananda is really a great read for those who consider themselves disciples of the master & those who do not, but have an interest in the growth of Yoga and Hinduism here in the US. The challenge with writing a book like this is that an author risks significant criticism by both the camp that sees Yogananda as a God realized guru and those who do not.  Phil Goldberg walks that middle ground very deftly. To be clear, he is not a member of SRF or any of the various splinter orgs that have sprung up since Yogananda's death. Yet Goldberg is an expert (I'd call him a scholar but he is not credentialed as one) in the realm of eastern spirituality here in the West. A journalist without his background could not have been as insightful. If you have a mantra, chant at kirtans, practice Hatha Yoga, etc. this is a must read.;1533766770179;Details of Yogananda's life, not found in the Autobiography;AEQ5AV2MRQWDHTKVJBCBGIOJABVQ;False

I appreciated the fact that unlike most books with a religious element, it does not attempt to draw a line between real, raw life and ""Christian"" life.  It is just LIFE, and the characters' faith is what helps them cope with the realities of life, however bizarre they may be.  Matt gives us a glimpse into the fact that a pastor is still a real person like the rest of us, and the book gives us a light-hearted (and sometimes more serious) look into the way other people tend to perceive those who serve in the role of pastor.<br /><br />I think this book would not only appeal to people who attend church, but also people who have never been and are curious about a scenario where a pastor accidentally wins the lottery.  You have to admit it is an interesting topic, and one that, to my knowledge, has not been done before.

0415459524;6;0415459524;5.0;"This is an excellent description of John Boyd's ideas. Osinga begins by summarizing key ideas expressed in the books Boyd read or cited--which is essentially a summary of several scientific schools of thought--as well as Boyd's analysis of military history. This provides a clear understanding of where Boyd started, and makes his own work easier to understand. Boyd took certain patterns, turns of phrase, and ways of thinking, from other field and applied them to war. The significance of this would not be clear had Osinga not provided the necessary background information.<br /><br />Equally valuable is Osinga's explanation of Boyd's essays and lectures, which are very abstract. Each one builds off the previous work, and in some ways that process is as important as the result. Boyd did not provide a comprehensive doctrine, but rather a mindset. This way of thinking permits the development of a doctrine suited to the circumstances. As Osinga demonstrates, the &#34;OODA Loop&#34; is NOT Boyd's only idea, or even his most important one. He also shows that the common belief that Boyd claimed the key to victory was rapidly cycling through the OODA Loop is incorrect. Successful armies act quickly, but acting quickly does not make an army successful.<br /><br />John Boyd's other ideas are difficult to summarize here without reproducing Osinga's excellent book, because they build on one another. But Osinga clearly and concisely connected the dots without overshadowing Boyd's own words. This book is as essential for understanding modern military theory as ON WAR.";1499723572116;A Necessary Supplement to Clausewitz;AHSITHOD4CH4HPWB4EK32MXPHELQ;True
